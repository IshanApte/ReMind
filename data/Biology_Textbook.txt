note: After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Describe the structure of the body, from simplest to most complex, in terms of the six levels
of organization
• List characteristics of human life
• Dene homeostasis and explain its importance to normal human functioning
Though you may approach a course in human biology strictly as a requirement for obtaining your degree, the
knowledge you gain in this course will serve you well in many aspects of your life. An understanding of your
body and how it works can benet your own health. Familiarity with the human body can help you make
healthful choices and prompt you to take appropriate action when signs of illness arise. Your knowledge in
this eld will help you understand news about nutrition, medications, medical devices, and procedures. This
knowledge will also help you understand genetic and infectious diseases. At some point, everyone will have a
problem with some aspect of his or her body and your knowledge can help you to be a better parent, spouse,
partner, friend, or caregiver.
This chapter begins with an overview of anatomy and physiology. It then covers the characteristics of
life and how the body works to maintain stable conditions.
1.2 Structural Organization of the Human Body2
Before you begin to study the dierent structures and functions of the human body, it is helpful to consider
its basic architecture; that is, how its smallest parts are assembled into larger structures. It is convenient to
consider the structures of the body in terms of fundamental levels of organization that increase in complexity:
subatomic particles (e.g. protons, neutrons, and electrons), atoms, molecules, macromolecules (e.g. carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids) organelles, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, and organisms

macromolecule level (which is located between molecules and organelles) isn't shown.
Note: The
1.2.1 The Levels of Organization
To study the chemical level of organization, scientists consider the simplest building blocks of matter: subatomic particles, atoms and molecules. All matter in the universe is composed of one or more unique pure
substances called elements, familiar examples of which are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and
iron. The smallest unit of any of these pure substances (elements) is an atom. Atoms are made up of subatomic particles such as the proton, electron and neutron. Two or more atoms combine to form a molecule,
such as the water molecules, proteins, and sugars found in living things. Molecules are the chemical building
blocks of all body structures.
A
cell is the smallest independently functioning unit of a living organism. Even bacteria, which are
extremely small, independently-living organisms, have a cellular structure. Each bacterium is a single cell.
All living structures of human anatomy contain cells, and almost all functions of human physiology are
performed in cells or are initiated by cells.
A human cell typically consists of exible membranes that enclose cytoplasm, a water-based cellular
organelles. In humans, as in all organisms,
tissue is a group of many similar cells (though sometimes composed
of a few related types) that work together to perform a specic function. An organ is an anatomically

organ systems can be imprecise since organs that belong to one system can also have functions integral to
another system. In fact, most organs contribute to more than one system. In this course, we will discuss
some, but not all, of these organ systems.

INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN BIOLOGY AND THE
SCIENTIFIC METHOD
The organism level is the highest level of organization. An
organism is a living being that has a cellular
structure and that can independently perform all physiologic functions necessary for life. In multicellular
organisms, including humans, all cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems of the body work together to
maintain the life and health of the organism.
1.2.2 Chapter Review
Life processes of the human body are maintained at several levels of structural organization. These include
the chemical, cellular, tissue, organ, organ system, and the organism level. Higher levels of organization are
built from lower levels. Therefore, subatomic particles combine to produce atoms, atoms combine to produce
molecules, molecules combine to produce macromolecules, macromolecules contribute to the formation of
organelles which combine to form cells, cells combine to form tissues, tissues combine to form organs, organs
combine to form organ systems, and organ systems combine to form organisms.
1.3 Functions of Human Life3
The dierent organ systems each have dierent functions and therefore unique roles to perform in physiology.
These many functions can be summarized in terms of a few that we might consider denitive of
human life:
organization, metabolism, responsiveness, homeostasis, adaptation, movement, development,
and reproduction.
1.3.1 Organization
A human body consists of trillions of cells organized in a way that maintains distinct internal compartments.
These compartments keep body cells separated from external environmental threats and keep the cells moist
and nourished.
They also separate internal body uids from the countless microorganisms that grow on
body surfaces, including the lining of certain tracts, or passageways. The intestinal tract, for example, is
home to even more bacteria cells than the total of all human cells in the body, yet these bacteria are outside
the body and cannot be allowed to circulate freely inside the body.
Cells, for example, have a cell membrane (also referred to as the plasma membrane) that keeps the
intracellular environmentthe uids and organellesseparate from the extracellular environment.
Blood
vessels keep blood inside a closed circulatory system, and nerves and muscles are wrapped in connective
tissue sheaths that separate them from surrounding structures.
In the chest and abdomen, a variety of
internal membranes keep major organs such as the lungs, heart, and kidneys separate from others.
The body's largest organ system is the integumentary system, which includes the skin and its associated
structures, such as hair and nails. The surface tissue of skin is a barrier that protects internal structures
and uids from potentially harmful microorganisms and other toxins.
1.3.2 Metabolism
The rst law of thermodynamics holds that energy can neither be created nor destroyedit can only change
form.
Your basic function as an organism is to consume (ingest) molecules in the foods you eat, convert
some of it into fuel for movement, sustain your body functions, and build and maintain your body structures.
There are two types of reactions that accomplish this:
anabolism and catabolism.
• Anabolism is the process whereby smaller, simpler molecules are combined into larger, more complex
substances. Your body can assemble, by utilizing energy, the complex chemicals it needs by combining
small molecules derived from the foods you eat
• Catabolism is the process by which larger more complex substances are broken down into smaller
simpler molecules. Catabolism releases energy. The complex molecules found in foods are broken down
so the body can use their parts to assemble the structures and substances needed for life.
Taken together, these two processes are called metabolism.
Metabolism is the sum of all anabolic and
occur simultaneously and continuously to keep you alive.
CHAPTER 1.
INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN BIOLOGY AND THE
SCIENTIFIC METHOD
Metabolism
break materials down and release energy. Metabolism includes both anabolic and catabolic reactions.
Every cell in your body makes use of a chemical compound,
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to store
and release energy. Think of ATP as the energy "currency" of the cell. If energy is needed for something
to happen in the cell, then ATP is used to "pay the energy bill". The cell stores energy in the synthesis
(anabolism) of ATP, then moves the ATP molecules to the location where energy is needed to fuel cellular
activities. Then the ATP is broken down (catabolism) and a controlled amount of energy is released, which
is used by the cell to perform a particular job.
1.3.3 Responsiveness
Responsiveness is the ability of an organism to adjust to changes in its internal and external environments.
An example of responsiveness to external stimuli could include moving toward sources of food and water
and away from perceived dangers. Changes in an organism's internal environment, such as increased body
temperature, can cause the responses of sweating and the dilation of blood vessels in the skin in order to
1.3.4 Homeostasis
To function properly, cells require appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and concentrations
of diverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms are
able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes,
through a process called homeostasis or steady statethe ability of an organism to maintain constant
internal conditions. For example, many organisms regulate their body temperature in a process known as
thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear, have body structures that
help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. In hot climates, organisms have methods
(such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat. As we discuss
organ systems, the concept of homeostasis will be critically important to remember.
1.3.5 Adaptation
All living organisms exhibit a t to their environment. Biologists refer to this t as adaptation and it is a
consequence of evolution by natural selection (i.e. survival of the ttest), which operates in every lineage of
reproducing organisms. Examples of adaptations are diverse and unique, from heat-resistant bacteria that
live in boiling hot springs to the tongue length of a nectar-feeding moth that matches the size of the ower
from which it feeds. All adaptations enhance the reproductive potential of the individual exhibiting them,
including their ability to survive to reproduce. Adaptations are not constant. As an environment changes,
natural selection causes the characteristics of the individuals in a population to track those changes.
1.3.6 Movement
Human movement includes not only actions at the joints of the body, but also the motion of individual
organs and even individual cells. As you read these words, red and white blood cells are moving throughout
your body, muscle cells are contracting and relaxing to maintain your posture and to focus your vision, and
glands are secreting chemicals to regulate body functions. Your body is coordinating the action of entire
muscle groups to enable you to move air into and out of your lungs, to push blood throughout your body,
and to propel the food you have eaten through your digestive tract. Consciously, of course, you contract
your skeletal muscles to move the bones of your skeleton to get from one place to another (as the runners

1.3.7 Development, growth and reproduction
Development is all of the changes the body goes through in life. Development includes the processes of
dierentiation, growth, and renewal.
Growth is the increase in body size. Humans, like all multicellular organisms, grow by increasing the
number of existing cells, increasing the amount of non-cellular material around cells (such as mineral deposits
in bone), and, within very narrow limits, increasing the size of existing cells.
Reproduction is the formation of a new organism from parent organisms. In humans, reproduction is
carried out by the male and female reproductive systems. Because death will come to all complex organisms,
without reproduction, the line of organisms would end.

They occur continuously
These processes include: organization, in terms of the maintenance
of essential body boundaries; metabolism, including energy transfer via anabolic and catabolic reactions;
responsiveness; homeostasis; adaptation; movement; and growth, dierentiation, reproduction, and renewal.

1.4 Classication of Organisms5
1.4.1 The Diversity of Life
In the 18th century, a scientist named Carl Linnaeus rst proposed organizing the known species of organisms
into a hierarchical taxonomy. In this system, species that are most similar to each other are put together
within a grouping known as a genus.
Furthermore, similar genera (the plural of genus) are put together
within a family. This grouping continues until all organisms are collected together into groups at the highest
level. The current taxonomic system now has eight levels in its hierarchy, from lowest to highest: species,
genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain. Thus species are grouped within genera, genera are
This diagram shows the levels of taxonomic hierarchy for a dog, from the broadest
categorydomainto the most specicspecies.
Notice that humans and dogs diverge at the level
of order. Humans are classied in the following levels: order-Primates; family-Hominidae; genus: Homo;
species- Homo sapiens; scientic/binomial name: Homo sapiens.
In addition to the hierarchical taxonomic system, Linnaeus was the rst to name organisms using two
unique names, now called the binomial naming system. Before Linnaeus, the use of common names to refer
to organisms caused confusion because there were regional dierences in these common names. Binomial
names (also called scientic names) consist of the genus name (which is capitalized) and the species name (all
lower-case). Both names are set in italics when they are printed. Every species is given a unique binomial
which is recognized the world over, so that a scientist in any location can know which organism is being
referred to. For example, the North American blue jay is known uniquely as Cyanocitta cristata. Our own
species is Homo sapiens.

1.5 The Process of Science6
Like geology, physics, and chemistry, biology is a science that gathers knowledge about the natural world.
Specically, biology is the study of life. The discoveries of biology are made by a community of researchers
who work individually and together using agreed-on methods. In this sense, biology, like all sciences is a social
enterprise like politics or the arts. The methods of science include careful observation, record keeping, logical
and mathematical reasoning, experimentation, and submitting conclusions to the scrutiny of others. Science
also requires considerable imagination and creativity; a well-designed experiment is commonly described
as elegant, or beautiful.
Like politics, science has considerable practical implications and some science
Other science
proceeds largely motivated by curiosity. Whatever its goal, there is no doubt that science, including biology,
has transformed human existence and will continue to do so.
Biologists may choose to study Escherichia coli (E. coli ), a bacterium that is a normal
resident of our digestive tracts but which is also sometimes responsible for disease outbreaks.
In this
micrograph, the bacterium is visualized using a scanning electron microscope and digital colorization.
CHAPTER 1.
INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN BIOLOGY AND THE
SCIENTIFIC METHOD
1.5.1 The Nature of Science
Biology is a science, but what exactly is science? What does the study of biology share with other scientic
disciplines?
Science (from the Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge") can be dened as knowledge about the
natural world.
Science is a very specic way of learning, or knowing, about the world. The history of the past 500 years
demonstrates that science is a very powerful way of knowing about the world; it is largely responsible for the
technological revolutions that have taken place during this time. There are however, areas of knowledge and
human experience that the methods of science cannot be applied to. These include such things as answering
purely moral questions, aesthetic questions, or what can be generally categorized as spiritual questions.
Science has cannot investigate these areas because they are outside the realm of material phenomena, the
phenomena of matter and energy, and cannot be observed and measured.
The
scientic method is a method of research with dened steps that include experiments and careful
observation. The steps of the scientic method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important
aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses. A
hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event,
which can be tested. Hypotheses, or tentative explanations, are generally produced within the context of a
scientic theory. A scientic theory is a generally accepted, thoroughly tested and conrmed explanation
for a set of observations or phenomena. Scientic theory is the foundation of scientic knowledge. In addition,
in many scientic disciplines (less so in biology) there are
scientic laws, often expressed in mathematical
formulas, which describe how elements of nature will behave under certain specic conditions. There is not
an evolution of hypotheses through theories to laws as if they represented some increase in certainty about
the world. Hypotheses are the day-to-day material that scientists work with and they are developed within
the context of theories. Laws are concise descriptions of parts of the world that are amenable to formulaic
or mathematical description.
1.5.1.1 Scientic Inquiry
One thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal to know. Curiosity and inquiry are the driving
forces for the development of science. Scientists seek to understand the world and the way it operates. There

science aims to observe, explore, and discover, while hypothesis-based science begins
are two main pathways of scientic study: descriptive science and hypothesis-based science.
(or discovery)
with a specic question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested. The boundary
between these two forms of study is often blurred, because most scientic endeavors combine both approaches.
Observations lead to questions, questions lead to forming a hypothesis as a possible answer to those questions,
and then the hypothesis is tested. Thus, descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous
dialogue.
1.5.2 Hypothesis Testing
Biologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses.
This
approach is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientic method. The scientic
method was used even in ancient times, but it was rst documented by England's Sir Francis Bacon (1561
anything as a logical problem-solving method.
The scientic process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to be solved) that leads to
a question.
Let's think about a simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientic
method to solve the problem. One Monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that
the classroom is too warm. That is an observation that also describes a problem: the classroom is too warm.
The student then asks a question: Why is the classroom so warm?
Recall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested.
To solve a problem, several
hypotheses may be proposed. For example, one hypothesis might be, The classroom is warm because no
one turned on the air conditioning. But there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other
hypotheses may be proposed.
A second hypothesis might be, The classroom is warm because there is a
power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn't work.
Once a hypothesis has been selected, a prediction may be made. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis
but it typically has the format If . . . then . . . . For example, the prediction for the rst hypothesis might
be,  If the student turns on the air conditioning, then the classroom will no longer be too warm. Notice
that the portion of the statement after the word "then" indicates what will be observed if the hypothesis is
correct.
A hypothesis must be testable to ensure that it is valid.
For example, a hypothesis that depends on
what a bear thinks is not testable, because it can never be known what a bear thinks.
It should also
CHAPTER 1.
be
INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN BIOLOGY AND THE
SCIENTIFIC METHOD
falsiable, meaning that it can be shown to be incorrect by experimental results. An example of an
unfalsiable hypothesis is Botticelli's Birth of Venus is beautiful. There is no experiment that might show
this statement to be false. To test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one or more experiments designed
to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. This is important. A hypothesis can be shown to be incorrect,
or eliminated, but it can never be proven. Science does not deal in proofs like mathematics. If an experiment
fails to show a hypothesis is incorrect, then we nd support for that explanation, but this is not to say that
down the road a better explanation will not be found, or a more carefully designed experiment will be found
to falsify the hypothesis.
Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls. A
variable is any part of
the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment. There are three types of variables we will
discuss: Independent variable(s) of interest, independent variables not of interest (i.e. controlled variables),
and dependent variables. Typically, basic experiments will only have one independent variable of interest (i.e.
the factor that is being changed in a deliberate manner to determine if it has an impact on the dependent
variable).
The dependent variable is the one being measured.
For example, if an experiment is designed
to test the eects of three dierent brands of plant fertilizer on plant growth, the independent variable of
interest is the brand of fertilizer and the dependent variable is plant growth. It is important to realize that
independent variables other than the brand of fertilizer could aect plant growth: soil moisture content,
amount of sunlight, temperature, etc. In order to prevent these variables from impacting the results, they
are "controlled", meaning they are not allowed to change during the experiment.
In other words, plants
treated with all three brands of fertilizer should have the same amounts of water and sunlight to prevent
these variables from interacting with the independent variable of interest. A
control group is a part of
the experiment that does not change and provides a baseline of comparison to determine the eect of the
independent variable of interest on the dependent variable. Look for the variables and controls in the example
that follows. An experiment is conducted to test the hypothesis that phosphate limits the growth of algae
in freshwater ponds. A series of articial ponds are lled with water and half of them are treated by adding
phosphate each week, while the other half are treated by adding a salt that is known not to be used by
algae. The independent variable of interest here is the phosphate (or lack of phosphate), the experimental
or treatment cases are the ponds with added phosphate and the control ponds are those with something
inert added, such as the salt. Just adding something is also a control against the possibility that adding
extra matter to the pond has an eect.
If the treated ponds show lesser growth of algae, then we have
found support for our hypothesis. If they do not, then we reject our hypothesis. Be aware that rejecting one
hypothesis does not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates one
with experimental data are rejected. In human drug trials, it is common for the control group to be given
a placebo (i.e. "sugar pill") so that individuals both groups (experimental and control) are taking a pill.
Otherwise, the act of taking a pill would be a variable that wasn't controlled. It is also common for neither
the subjects nor the researchers directly working with them to know which group is receiving the placebo.
This feature of experiments, called a double-blind design, is included to prevent any bias from inuencing
the results.
:
The scientic method is a series of dened steps that include experiments and careful
observation. If a hypothesis is not supported by data, a new hypothesis can be proposed.
In practice, the scientic method is not as rigid and structured as it might at rst appear. Sometimes an
experiment leads to conclusions that favor a change in approach; often, an experiment brings entirely new
scientic questions to the puzzle. Many times, science does not operate in a linear fashion; instead, scientists
continually draw inferences and make generalizations, nding patterns as their research proceeds. Scientic
reasoning is more complex than the scientic method alone suggests.
1.5.3 Reporting Scientic Work
Whether scientic research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their ndings for other
researchers to expand and build upon their discoveries. Communication and collaboration within and between
sub disciplines of science are key to the advancement of knowledge in science. For this reason, an important
aspect of a scientist's work is disseminating results and communicating with peers.
Scientists can share
results by presenting them at a scientic meeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the limited
few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed articles that are published
in scientic journals.
Peer-reviewed articles are scientic papers that are reviewed, usually anonymously
by a scientist's colleagues, or peers.
These colleagues are qualied individuals, often experts in the same
research area, who judge whether or not the scientist's work is suitable for publication.
The process of
peer review helps to ensure that the research described in a scientic paper or grant proposal is original,
signicant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for research funding, are also subject
to peer review.
Scientists publish their work so other scientists can reproduce their experiments under
similar or dierent conditions to expand on the ndings. The experimental results must be consistent with
the ndings of other scientists.
There are many journals and the popular press that do not use a peer-review system. A large number of
online open-access journals, journals with articles available without cost, are now available many of which
use rigorous peer-review systems, but some of which do not. Results of any studies published in these forums
without peer review are not reliable and should not form the basis for other scientic work. In one exception,
CHAPTER 1.
INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN BIOLOGY AND THE
SCIENTIFIC METHOD
journals may allow a researcher to cite a personal communication from another researcher about unpublished
results with the cited author's permission.
1.5.4 Section Summary
A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for an observation. A scientic theory is a well-tested and consistently
veried explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. A scientic law is a description, often in the
form of a mathematical formula, of the behavior of an aspect of nature under certain circumstances. The
common thread throughout scientic research is the use of the scientic method.
Scientists present their
results in peer-reviewed scientic papers published in scientic journals.
1.5.6 Multiple Choice

CHAPTER 2.
CHEMISTRY AND LIFE
The elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus are the key building blocks of the
chemicals found in living things.
They form the carbohydrates, nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids (all of
which will be dened later in this chapter) that are the fundamental molecular components of all organisms.
In this chapter, we will discuss these important building blocks and learn how the unique properties of the
atoms of dierent elements aect their interactions with other atoms to form the molecules of life.
Food provides an organism with nutrientsthe matter it needs to survive. Many of these critical nutrients
come in the form of biological macromolecules, or large molecules necessary for life. These macromolecules
are built from dierent combinations of smaller organic molecules. What specic types of biological macromolecules do living things require? How are these molecules formed? What functions do they serve? In this
chapter, we will explore these questions.
2.2 The Building Blocks of Molecules2
Matter occupies space and has mass. All matter

is composed of
substances. Each element is made of atoms, each with a constant number of protons and unique properties.
A total of 118 elements have been dened; however, only 92 occur naturally, and fewer than 30 are found
in living cells.
The remaining 26 elements are unstable and, therefore, do not exist for very long or are
theoretical and have yet to be detected.
Each element is designated by its chemical symbol (such as H, N, O, C, and Na), and possesses unique
properties. These unique properties allow elements to combine and to bond with each other in specic ways.
2.2.1 Atoms
An atom is the smallest component of an element that retains all of the chemical properties of that element.
For example, one hydrogen atom has all of the properties of the element hydrogen, such as it exists as a
gas at room temperature, and it bonds with oxygen to create a water molecule. Hydrogen atoms cannot be
broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of hydrogen. If a hydrogen atom were
broken down into subatomic particles (i.e. protons, neutrons, and electrons), it would no longer have the
properties of hydrogen.
At the most basic level, all organisms are made of a combination of elements. They contain atoms that
combine together to form molecules. In multicellular organisms, such as animals, molecules can interact to
form cells that combine to form tissues, which make up organs. These combinations continue until entire
multicellular organisms are formed.
A proton is a positively charged particle that resides in
nucleus (the core of the atom) of an atom and has a mass of 1 and a charge of +1. An electron is a
which is made of one proton and one electron.
the
negatively charged particle that travels in the space around the nucleus. In other words, it resides outside
of the nucleus. It has a negligible mass (i.e. considered to be zero compared to protons and neutrons) and
has a charge of 1.
Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus, and electrons
surrounding the nucleus.
Neutrons, like protons, reside in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of 1 and no charge. The
positive (protons) and negative (electrons) charges balance each other in a neutral atom, which has a net
zero charge.
Because protons and neutrons each have a mass of 1, the mass of an atom is equal to the combined
number of protons and neutrons of that atom.
The number of electrons does not factor into the overall
mass, because their mass is so small.
As stated earlier, each element has its own unique properties. Each contains a dierent number of protons

equal to the number of protons that element contains. The
of protons plus the number of neutrons of that element. Therefore, it is possible to determine the number of
neutrons by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number. For example, the element phosphorus
(P) has an atomic number of 15 and a mass number of 31. Therefore, an atom of phosphorus has 15 protons,
15 electrons, and 16 neutrons (31-15 = 16).
These numbers provide information about the elements and how they will react when combined. Dierent
elements have dierent melting and boiling points, and are in dierent states (liquid, solid, or gas) at room
temperature. They also combine in dierent ways. Some form specic types of bonds, whereas others do
not. How they combine is based on the number of electrons present. Because of these characteristics, the
elements are arranged into the
periodic table of elements, a chart of the elements that includes the atomic
number and relative atomic mass of each element. The periodic table also provides key information about
shows how the electrons in each element are organized and provides important details about how atoms will
react with each other to form molecules.
Isotopes are dierent forms of the same element that have the same number of protons, but a dierent
number of neutrons.
Some elements, such as carbon, potassium, and uranium, have naturally occurring
isotopes. Carbon-12, the most common isotope of carbon, contains six protons and six neutrons. Therefore,
it has a mass number of 12 (six protons and six neutrons) and an atomic number of 6 (which makes it
carbon). Carbon-14 contains six protons and eight neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 14 (six
protons and eight neutrons) and an atomic number of 6, meaning it is still the element carbon. These two

2.2.2 Chemical Bonds
How elements interact with one another depends on how their electrons are arranged and how many openings
for electrons exist at the outermost region where electrons are present in an atom. Electrons exist at energy
levels that form shells around the nucleus. The closest shell can hold up to two electrons. The closest shell
to the nucleus is always lled rst, before any other shell can be lled. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore,
it has only one spot occupied within the lowest shell. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely

CHEMISTRY AND LIFE
ll the lowest shell with its two electrons. If you look at the periodic table, you will see that hydrogen and
helium are the only two elements in the rst row. This is because they only have electrons in their rst shell.
Hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the lowest shell and no other shells.
The second and third energy levels can hold up to eight electrons. The eight electrons are arranged in
four pairs and one position in each pair is lled with an electron before any pairs are completed.
correspond to the number of shells that the elements within that row have. The elements within a particular
row have increasing numbers of electrons as the columns proceed from left to right. Although each element
has the same number of shells, not all of the shells are completely lled with electrons. If you look at the
second row of the periodic table, you will nd lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen
(N), oxygen (O), uorine (F), and neon (Ne). These all have electrons that occupy only the rst and second
shells. Lithium has only one electron in its outermost shell, beryllium has two electrons, boron has three,
and so on, until the entire shell is lled with eight electrons, as is the case with neon.
Not all elements have enough electrons to ll their outermost shells, but an atom is at its most stable
when all of the electron positions in the outermost shell are lled. Because of these vacancies in the outermost
shells, we see the formation of
chemical bonds, or interactions between two or more of the same or dierent
elements that result in the formation of molecules. To achieve greater stability, atoms will tend to completely
ll their outer shells and will bond with other elements to accomplish this goal by sharing electrons, accepting
electrons from another atom, or donating electrons to another atom. Because the outermost shells of the
elements with low atomic numbers (up to calcium, with atomic number 20) can hold eight electrons, this is
referred to as the
octet rule. An element can donate, accept, or share electrons with other elements to ll
its outer shell and satisfy the octet rule.
When an atom does not contain equal numbers of protons and electrons, it is called an
ion. Because
the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge. Positive ions are
formed by losing electrons and are called
called
anions.
cations. Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are
For example, sodium only has one electron in its outermost shell.
It takes less energy for sodium to
donate that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to ll the outer shell. If sodium loses
an electron, it now has 11 protons and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now
called a sodium ion.
The chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-ecient for chlorine to
gain one electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons
and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative (1) charge. It is now called a chloride ion. This movement of
electrons from one element to another is referred to as
atom (Na) only has one electron in its outermost shell, whereas a chlorine atom (Cl) has seven electrons
in its outermost shell. A sodium atom will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and a chlorine atom
will accept that electron to ll its shell, becoming chloride. Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have
complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons,
each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium) or 1 (chloride) charge.
Elements tend to ll their outermost shells with electrons.
To do this, they can either
donate or accept electrons from other elements.
2.2.2.1 Ionic Bonds
We will study three types of bonds or interactions: ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds. When an element
donates an electron from its outer shell, as in the sodium atom example above, a positive ion is formed. The
element accepting the electron is now negatively charged.
these ions stay together and form an

with the electron from one element staying predominantly with the other element. When Na
combine to produce NaCl, an electron from a sodium atom stays with the other seven from the chlorine
atom, and the sodium and chloride ions attract each other in a lattice of ions with a net zero charge.
2.2.2.2 Covalent Bonds
Another type of chemical bond between two or more atoms is a
covalent bond. These bonds form when
an electron is shared between two elements and are the strongest and most common form of chemical bond
in living organisms. Covalent bonds form between the elements that make up the biological molecules in our
cells. Unlike ionic bonds, covalent bonds do not dissociate (i.e. separate) in water.
CHAPTER 2.
CHEMISTRY AND LIFE
The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent
bonds. The electron from the hydrogen atom divides its time between the outer shell of the hydrogen atom
and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atom. To completely ll the outer shell of an oxygen atom, two
electrons from two hydrogen atoms are needed, hence the subscript 2 in H2 O. The electrons are shared
between the atoms, dividing their time between them to ll the outer shell of each. This sharing is a lower
energy state for all of the atoms involved than if they existed without their outer shells lled.
There are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar.
Nonpolar covalent bonds form between
two atoms of the same element or between dierent elements that share the electrons equally. For example,
an oxygen atom can bond with another oxygen atom to ll their outer shells. This association is nonpolar
because the electrons will be equally distributed between each oxygen atom.
Two covalent bonds form
between the two oxygen atoms because oxygen requires two shared electrons to ll its outermost shell.
Nitrogen atoms will form three covalent bonds (also called triple covalent) between two atoms of nitrogen
because each nitrogen atom needs three electrons to ll its outermost shell. Another example of a nonpolar
covalent bond is found in the methane (CH4 ) molecule. The carbon atom has four electrons in its outermost
shell and needs four more to ll it. It gets these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one.
In a
polar covalent bond, the electrons shared by the atoms spend more time closer to one nucleus
than to the other nucleus. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the dierent nuclei, a
slightly positive (δ +) or slightly negative (δ ) charge develops. The covalent bonds between hydrogen and
oxygen atoms in water are polar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend more time near the oxygen
nucleus, giving it a small negative charge, than they spend near the hydrogen nuclei, giving these molecules
a small positive charge.
The water molecule (left) depicts a polar bond with a slightly positive charge on the
hydrogen atoms and a slightly negative charge on the oxygen.
Examples of nonpolar bonds include
methane (middle) and oxygen (right).
2.2.2.3 Hydrogen Bonds
Ionic and covalent bonds are strong bonds that require considerable energy to break. However, not all bonds
between elements are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form. These are attractions that occur
between positive and negative charges that do not require much energy to break. An example of relatively
weak bonds that occur frequently is hydrogen bonds. This bond gives rise to the unique properties of water
and the unique structures of DNA and proteins.
When polar covalent bonds containing a hydrogen atom form, the hydrogen atom in that bond has a
slightly positive charge. This is because the shared electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element
and away from the hydrogen nucleus. Because the hydrogen atom is slightly positive (δ +), it will be attracted
to neighboring negative partial charges (δ ). When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the δ +
charge of the hydrogen atom of one molecule and the δ  charge of the other molecule. This interaction is
called a
hydrogen bond. This type of bond is common; for example, the liquid nature of water is caused by
that sustain life. If it were not for hydrogen bonding, water would be a gas rather than a liquid at room
temperature.
polar covalent molecules, such as water.
Hydrogen bonds can form between dierent molecules and they do not always have to include a water
molecule. Hydrogen atoms in polar bonds within any molecule can form bonds with other adjacent molecules.
For example, hydrogen bonds hold together two long strands of DNA to give the DNA molecule its characteristic double-helix structure.
Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for some of the three-dimensional
structure of proteins.
2.2.3 Section Summary
Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. It is made up of atoms of dierent elements. All of
the 92 elements that occur naturally have unique qualities that allow them to combine in various ways to
create compounds or molecules. Atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the smallest
units of an element that retain all of the properties of that element. Electrons can be donated or shared
between atoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds.

2.3 The Chemical and Physical Properties of Water4
Do you ever wonder why scientists spend time looking for water on other planets? It is because water is
essential to life; even minute traces of it on another planet can indicate that life could or did exist on that
planet. Water is one of the more abundant molecules in living cells and the one most critical to life as we
know it. Approximately 6070 percent of your body is made up of water. Without it, life simply would not
exist.
2.3.1 Water Is Polar
The hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water molecules form polar covalent bonds. The shared electrons
spend more time associated with the oxygen atom than they do with hydrogen atoms. There is no overall
charge to a water molecule, but there is a slight positive charge on each hydrogen atom and a slight negative
charge on the oxygen atom. Because of these charges, the slightly positive hydrogen atoms repel each other.
Each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the positive and negative charges in the
dierent parts of the molecule. Water also attracts other polar molecules (such as sugars), forming hydrogen
bonds. When a substance readily forms hydrogen bonds with water, it can dissolve in water and is referred to
as
hydrophilic (water-loving). Hydrogen bonds are not readily formed with nonpolar substances like oils
hydrophobic (water-fearing) and will not dissolve
in water.
2.3.2 Water Stabilizes Temperature
The hydrogen bonds in water allow it to absorb and release heat energy more slowly than many other
substances.
Temperature is a measure of the motion (kinetic energy) of molecules. As the motion increases,
energy is higher and thus temperature is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature
rises. Increased energy disrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Because these bonds can be
created and disrupted rapidly, water absorbs an increase in energy and temperature changes only minimally.
This means that water moderates temperature changes within organisms and in their environments.
As
energy input continues, the balance between hydrogen-bond formation and destruction swings toward the
CHAPTER 2.
CHEMISTRY AND LIFE
destruction side. More bonds are broken than are formed. This process results in the release of individual
water molecules at the surface of the liquid (such as a body of water, the leaves of a plant, or the skin of
an organism) in a process called
evaporation. Evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows for
cooling of an organism, because breaking hydrogen bonds requires an input of energy and takes heat away
from the body.
2.3.3 Water Is an Excellent Solvent
Because water is polar, with slight positive and negative charges, ionic compounds and polar molecules can
readily dissolve in it. Water is, therefore, what is referred to as a
solventa substance capable of dissolving
another substance, referred to as the solute, in order to form a solution. The charged particles will form
hydrogen bonds with a surrounding layer of water molecules. This is referred to as a sphere of hydration
and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water. In the case of table salt (NaCl) mixed
hydration are formed around the ions.
A positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially
negative charges of oxygen atoms in water molecules. A negatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the
partially positive charges of hydrogen atoms in water molecules. The polarity of the water molecule makes
it an eective solvent and is important in its many roles in living systems.
2.3.4 Buers, pH, Acids, and Bases
The pH of a solution is a measure of its acidity or alkalinity. You have probably used
litmus paper, paper
that has been treated with a natural water-soluble dye so it can be used as a pH indicator, to test how much
acid or base (alkalinity) exists in a solution. You might have even used some to make sure the water in an
outdoor swimming pool is properly treated. In both cases, this pH test measures the amount of hydrogen
ions that exists in a given solution. High concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH, whereas low levels
of hydrogen ions result in a high pH. The overall concentration of hydrogen ions is inversely related to its
pH and can be measured on the
lower the pH; conversely, the fewer hydrogen ions, the higher the pH.
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14.
A change of one unit on the pH scale represents a change in the
concentration of hydrogen ions by a factor of 10, a change in two units represents a change in the concentration
of hydrogen ions by a factor of 100. Thus, small changes in pH represent large changes in the concentrations
of hydrogen ions. Pure water is neutral. It is neither acidic nor basic, and has a pH of 7.0. Anything below
7.0 (ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. The blood in

Most cells in our bodies operate within a very narrow window of the pH scale, typically ranging only
from 7.2 to 7.6. If the pH of the body is outside of this range, the respiratory system malfunctions, as do
other organs in the body. Cells no longer function properly, and proteins will break down. Deviation outside
of the pH range can induce coma or even cause death.
So how is it that we can ingest or inhale acidic or basic substances and not die? Buers are the key.
Buers readily absorb excess H+ or OH , keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the aforemen-
tioned narrow range. Carbon dioxide is part of a prominent buer system in the human body; it keeps the

pH within the proper range. This buer system involves carbonic acid (H2 CO3 ) and bicarbonate (HCO3 )
anion. If too much H
+ enters the body, bicarbonate will combine with the H+ to create carbonic acid and
limit the decrease in pH. Likewise, if too much OH
 is introduced into the system, carbonic acid will rapidly

+

dissociate into bicarbonate and H ions. The H ions can combine with the OH ions, limiting the increase
in pH. While carbonic acid is an important product in this reaction, its presence is eeting because the
carbonic acid is released from the body as carbon dioxide gas each time we breathe. Without this buer
system, the pH in our bodies would uctuate too much and we would fail to survive.
2.3.5 Section Summary
Water has many properties that are critical to maintaining life. It is polar, allowing for the formation of
hydrogen bonds, which allow ions and other polar molecules to dissolve in water.
Therefore, water is an
excellent solvent. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules give water the ability to hold heat better
than many other substances. As the temperature rises, the hydrogen bonds between water continually break
and reform, allowing for the overall temperature to remain stable, although increased energy is added to the
system. All of these unique properties of water are important in the chemistry of living organisms.
The pH of a solution is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. A solution with a
high number of hydrogen ions is acidic and has a low pH value. A solution with a high number of hydroxide
ions is basic and has a high pH value.
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral.
Buers are solutions that moderate pH changes when an acid or base is added to the buer system. Buers
are important in biological systems because of their ability to maintain constant pH conditions.

2.4 Biological Macromolecules5
The large molecules necessary for life that are built from smaller organic molecules are called biological
macromolecules. There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins,
and nucleic acids), and each is an important component of the cell and performs a wide array of functions.
Combined, these molecules make up the majority of a cell's mass. Biological macromolecules are organic,
meaning that they contain carbon. In addition, they may contain hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus,
sulfur, and additional minor elements.
2.4.1 Carbon
It is often said that life is carbon-based. This means that carbon atoms, bonded to other carbon atoms or
other elements, form the fundamental components of many, if not most, of the molecules found uniquely in
living things. Other elements play important roles in biological molecules, but carbon certainly qualies as
the foundation element for molecules in living things. It is the bonding properties of carbon atoms that
are responsible for its important role.
2.4.2 Carbon Bonding
Carbon contains four electrons in its outer shell. Therefore, it can form four covalent bonds with other atoms
or molecules. The simplest organic carbon molecule is methane (CH4 ), in which four hydrogen atoms bind

nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms. (c) Glucose, a sugar, has a ring of ve carbon atoms and one

oxygen atom. The chemical formula for glucose is C H
2.4.3 Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are macromolecules with which most consumers are somewhat familiar. To lose weight,
some individuals adhere to low-carb diets. Athletes, in contrast, often carb-load before important competitions to ensure that they have sucient energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates are, in fact,
an essential part of our diet; grains, fruits, and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide energy to the body, particularly through glucose, a simple sugar. Carbohydrates also have
other important functions in humans, animals, and plants.
Carbohydrates can be represented by the formula (CH2 O)n , where n is the number of carbon atoms in
the molecule. In other words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules.
Carbohydrates are classied into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.
Monosaccharides (mono- = one; sacchar- = sweet) are simple sugars, the most common of which is
glucose. In monosaccharides, the number of carbon atoms usually ranges from three to six. Most monosaccharide names end with the sux -ose. Depending on the number of carbon atoms in the sugar, they may
be known as trioses (three carbon atoms), pentoses (ve carbon atoms), and hexoses (six carbon atoms).
The chemical formula for glucose is C6 H12 O6 . In most living species, glucose is an important source of
energy. During cellular respiration, energy is released from glucose, and that energy is used to help make
adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Plants synthesize glucose using carbon dioxide and water by the process
of photosynthesis, and the glucose, in turn, is used for the energy requirements of the plant.
The excess
synthesized glucose is often stored as starch that is broken down by other organisms that feed on plants.
Galactose (part of lactose, or milk sugar) and fructose (found in fruit) are other common monosaccharides. Although glucose, galactose, and fructose all have the same chemical formula (C6 H12 O6 ), they dier
structurally and chemically (and are known as isomers) because of diering arrangements of atoms in the
the same chemical formula but slightly dierent structures.
Disaccharides (di- = two) form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration-synthesis reaction
(a reaction in which the removal of a water molecule occurs). During this process, the hydroxyl group (OH)
of one monosaccharide combines with a hydrogen atom of another monosaccharide, releasing a molecule of
water (H2 O) and forming a covalent bond between atoms in the two sugar molecules.
CHAPTER 2.
CHEMISTRY AND LIFE
Common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Lactose is a disaccharide consisting of the
monomers glucose and galactose. It is found naturally in milk. Maltose, or malt sugar, is a disaccharide
formed from a dehydration reaction between two glucose molecules.
The most common disaccharide is
sucrose, or table sugar, which is composed of the monomers glucose and fructose.
A long chain of monosaccharides linked by covalent bonds is known as a
polysaccharide (poly- =
many). The chain may be branched or unbranched, and it may contain dierent types of monosaccharides.
Polysaccharides may be very large molecules. Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are examples of polysaccharides.
Starch is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of amylose and amylopectin (both polymers
of glucose).
Plants are able to synthesize glucose, and the excess glucose is stored as starch in dierent
plant parts, including roots and seeds. The starch that is consumed by animals is broken down into smaller
molecules, such as glucose. The cells can then absorb the glucose.
Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates, and is made up of monomers
of glucose.
Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored
in liver and muscle cells as a form of stored energy. Whenever glucose levels decrease, glycogen is broken
down to release glucose. In the case of muscle cells, the glucose is used to produce ATP for energy-requiring
processes. In the case of the liver, the glucose is released into the circulatory system to maintain blood sugar
homeostasis.
Cellulose is one of the most abundant natural biopolymers. The cell walls of plants are mostly made
of cellulose, which provides structural support to the cell. Wood and paper are mostly cellulosic in nature.
Cellulose is made up of glucose monomers that are linked by bonds between particular carbon atoms in the
glucose molecule.
Every other glucose monomer in cellulose is ipped over and packed tightly as extended long chains.
This gives cellulose its rigidity and high tensile strengthwhich is so important to plant cells.
passing through our digestive system is called dietary ber.
Cellulose
While the glucose-glucose bonds in cellulose
cannot be broken down by human digestive enzymes, animals such as cows, bualos, and horses (examples
of ruminants) are able to digest grass that is rich in cellulose and use it as a food source. In these animals,
certain species of bacteria reside in the rumen (a part of their digestive system) and secrete the enzyme
cellulase. The appendix also contains bacteria that break down cellulose, giving it an important role in the
digestive systems of ruminants. Cellulases can break down cellulose into glucose monomers that can be used
as an energy source by the animal.

Registered Dietitian
Obesity is a worldwide health concern, and many diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, are
becoming more prevalent because of obesity. This is one of the reasons why registered dietitians are
increasingly sought after for advice. Registered dietitians help plan food and nutrition programs
for individuals in various settings. They often work with patients in health-care facilities, designing
nutrition plans to prevent and treat diseases. For example, dietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to manage blood-sugar levels by eating the correct types and amounts of carbohydrates.
Dietitians may also work in nursing homes, schools, and private practices.
To become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelor's degree in dietetics, nutrition,
food technology, or a related eld. In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised
internship program and pass a national exam. Those who pursue careers in dietetics take courses in
nutrition, chemistry, biochemistry, biology, microbiology, and human physiology. Dietitians must
become experts in the chemistry and functions of food (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats).

2.4.4 Lipids
Lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are united by a common feature.
Lipids are hydrophobic
(water-fearing), or insoluble in water, because they are nonpolar molecules. This is because they are hydrocarbons that include only nonpolar carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen bonds. Lipids perform many dierent
functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of lipids called fats (or triglycerides).
For example,
they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry because of their water-repelling nature. Lipids are also the
building blocks of many hormones and are an important constituent of the plasma membrane. Lipids include
fats, oils, phospholipids, and steroids.
A
fat molecule, such as a triglyceride, consists of two main componentsglycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol
is an organic compound with three carbon atoms, ve hydrogen atoms, and three hydroxyl (OH) groups.
Fatty acids have a long chain of hydrocarbons to which an acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) is attached, hence
the name fatty acid. The number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36; most common are
those containing 1218 carbons. In a fat molecule, a fatty acid is attached to each of the three oxygen atoms in
reactions.
phospholipids, and steroids.
During this covalent bond formation, three water molecules are released. The three fatty acids in the fat
may be similar or dissimilar. These fats are also called
triglycerides because they have three fatty acids.
Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty
acid, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogaea, the scientic name for
peanuts.
Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated.
In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds
between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is saturated.
Saturated fatty acids
are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton
is maximized. When the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond, the fatty acid is an
acid.
Most unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are called
unsaturated fatty
oils. If there is only one carbon-

is more than one carbon-carbon double bond, then it is known as a polyunsaturated fat (e.g. canola oil).
Saturated fats tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic

acid and palmitic acid contained in meat, and the fat with butyric acid contained in butter, are examples
of saturated fats.
Mammals store fats in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy
most of the cell. In plants, fat or oil is stored in seeds and is used as a source of energy during embryonic
development.
Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain unsaturated fatty acids. The double bond
causes a bend or a kink that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room
temperature. Olive oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats. Unsaturated
fats help to improve blood cholesterol levels, whereas saturated fats contribute to plaque formation in the
arteries, which increases the risk of a heart attack.
In the food industry, oils are articially hydrogenated to make them semi-solid, leading to less spoilage
and increased shelf life. Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. During this
hydrogenation process, double bonds of the cis -conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted
to double bonds in the trans -conformation. This forms a
trans -fat from a cis -fat. The orientation of the
making a trans -fat from a cis -fat. This changes the chemical properties of the molecule.
Margarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of articially hydrogenated trans fats. Recent studies have shown that an increase in trans -fats in the human diet may lead to an increase in
levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or bad cholesterol, which, in turn, may lead to plaque deposition
in the arteries, resulting in heart disease. Many fast food restaurants have recently eliminated the use of
trans -fats, and U.S. food labels are now required to list their trans -fat content.
Salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are important in
brain function and normal growth and development. They may also prevent heart disease and reduce the
risk of cancer.
Like carbohydrates, fats have received a lot of bad publicity.
It is true that eating an excess of fried
foods and other fatty foods leads to weight gain. However, fats do have important functions. Fats serve as
long-term energy storage. They also provide insulation for the body. Therefore, healthy unsaturated fats
in moderate amounts should be consumed on a regular basis.
Phospholipids are the major constituent of the plasma membrane. Like fats, they are composed of
fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or similar backbone. Instead of three fatty acids attached, however,
there are two fatty acids and the third carbon of the glycerol backbone is bound to a phosphate group. The
phosphate group is modied by the addition of an alcohol.
A phospholipid has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. The fatty acid chains are hydrophobic
and exclude themselves from water, whereas the phosphate is hydrophilic and interacts with water.
Cells are surrounded by a membrane, which has a bilayer of phospholipids. The fatty acids of phospholipids face inside, away from water, whereas the phosphate group can face either the outside environment or
the inside of the cell, which are both aqueous.
2.4.4.1 Steroids
Unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier,
steroids have a ring structure. Although they do not
resemble other lipids, they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic. All steroids have four,
linked carbon rings and several of them, like cholesterol, have a short tail.
Cholesterol is a steroid. Cholesterol is mainly synthesized in the liver and is the precursor of many steroid
hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol. It is also the precursor of vitamins E and K. Cholesterol is
the precursor of bile salts, which help in the breakdown of fats and their subsequent absorption by cells.
Although cholesterol is often spoken of in negative terms, it is necessary for the proper functioning of the
body. It is a key component of the plasma membranes of animal cells.

2.4.5 Proteins
Proteins are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range
of functions of all macromolecules. Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they
may serve in transport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes.
Each cell in a living
system may contain thousands of dierent proteins, each with a unique function. Their structures, like their
functions, vary greatly. They are all, however, polymers of amino acids, arranged in a linear sequence.
The functions of proteins are very diverse because there are 20 dierent chemically distinct amino acids
that form long chains, and the amino acids can be in any order.
enzymes or hormones.
For example, proteins can function as

energy required to start them. Each enzyme is specic for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme)
upon which it acts. Enzymes can function to break molecular bonds, to rearrange bonds, or to form new
bonds. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which breaks down amylose, a component of starch.
Hormones are chemical signaling molecules, usually proteins or steroids, secreted by an endocrine gland
or group of endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specic physiological processes, including growth,
development, metabolism, and reproduction. For example, insulin is a protein hormone that maintains blood
glucose levels.
Proteins have dierent shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others
are brous in nature.
a brous protein.
For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is
Protein shape is critical to its function.
Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure
to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to a loss of function or
denaturation (to be discussed in more detail later). All proteins are made up of dierent arrangements of
the same 20 kinds of amino acids.
Amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental
structure, which consists of a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group (NH2 ), a carboxyl group (
COOH), and a hydrogen atom. Every amino acid also has another variable atom or group of atoms bonded
to the central carbon atom known as the R group. The R group is the only dierence in structure between
Amino acids are made up of a central carbon bonded to an amino group (NH ), a
carboxyl group (COOH), and a hydrogen atom.
The central carbon's fourth bond varies among the
dierent amino acids, as seen in these examples of alanine, valine, lysine, and aspartic acid.
The chemical nature of the R group determines the chemical nature of the amino acid within its protein
CHAPTER 2.
CHEMISTRY AND LIFE
(that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar).
The sequence and number of amino acids ultimately determine a protein's shape, size, and function.
Each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which is
formed by a dehydration reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of a second
amino acid combine, releasing a water molecule. The resulting bond is the peptide bond.
The products formed by such a linkage are called polypeptides. While the terms polypeptide and protein
are sometimes used interchangeably, a
polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids, whereas the
term protein is used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have combined together, have a distinct shape,
and have a unique function.
2.4.5.1 Protein Structure
As discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function. To understand how the protein gets its
nal shape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary,
The unique sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. The
unique sequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene (i.e. a section of DNA) that encodes
(i.e. has the information to make) the protein. Any change in the gene sequence may lead to a dierent
amino acid being added to the polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein structure and function. In
sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin β chain has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in both the
structure and function of the protein. What is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is
made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule,
therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The structural dierence between a normal hemoglobin molecule and
a sickle cell moleculethat dramatically decreases life expectancy in the aected individualsis a single
amino acid of the 600.
Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, the normally biconcave, or disc-shaped, red blood
cells assume a crescent or sickle shape, which clogs arteries. This can lead to a myriad of serious health
problems, such as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for those who have this disease.
Folding patterns resulting from interactions between the non-R group portions of amino acids give rise
to the secondary structure of the protein. The most common are the alpha (α)-helix and beta (β )-pleated
sheet structures. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds. In the alpha helix, the bonds form
between every fourth amino acid and cause a twist in the amino acid chain.
In the β -pleated sheet, the pleats are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of
the polypeptide chain. The R groups are attached to the carbons, and extend above and below the folds of
the pleat. The pleated segments align parallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the same
pairs of atoms on each of the aligned amino acids. The α-helix and β -pleated sheet structures are found in
many globular and brous proteins.
The unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is known as its tertiary structure. This structure
is caused by chemical interactions between various amino acids and regions of the polypeptide. Primarily,
the interactions among R groups create the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. There
may be ionic bonds formed between R groups on dierent amino acids, or hydrogen bonding beyond that
involved in the secondary structure. When protein folding takes place, the hydrophobic R groups of nonpolar
amino acids lay in the interior of the protein, whereas the hydrophilic R groups lay on the outside.
The
former types of interactions are also known as hydrophobic interactions.
In nature, some proteins are formed from several polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction
of these subunits forms the quaternary structure. Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize
the overall structure. For example, hemoglobin is a combination of four polypeptide subunits.

Each protein has its own unique sequence and shape held together by chemical interactions. If the protein
is subject to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing
CHAPTER 2.
CHEMISTRY AND LIFE
its shape in what is known as denaturation. Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure
is preserved if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function.
Sometimes
denaturation is irreversible, leading to a loss of function. One example of protein denaturation can be seen
when an egg is fried or boiled. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in
a hot pan, changing from a clear substance to an opaque white substance. Not all proteins are denatured
at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that are adapted to
function at those temperatures.

2.4.6 Nucleic Acids
Nucleic acids are key macromolecules in the continuity of life. They carry the genetic blueprint of a cell and
carry instructions for the functioning of the cell.
The two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid
(RNA). DNA is the genetic material found in all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to
multicellular mammals.
The other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never
leave the nucleus, but instead use an RNA intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. Other
types of RNA are also involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.
DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as
nucleotides. The nucleotides combine with each
other to form a polynucleotide, DNA or RNA. Each nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous
Each nitrogenous base in a
nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule, which is attached to a phosphate group.

phosphate group.
2.4.7 DNA Double-Helical Structure
Each strand is formed with bonds between phosphate and sugar groups of adjacent nucleotides (called a
phosphodiester bond). The two strands are bonded to each other at their bases with hydrogen bonds, and
the strands coil about each other along their length, hence the double helix description, which means a
double spiral.
CHAPTER 2.
CHEMISTRY AND LIFE
The double-helix model shows DNA as two parallel strands of intertwining molecules.
The alternating sugar and phosphate groups lie on the outside of each strand, forming the backbone of
the DNA. The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like the steps of a staircase, and these bases
pair; the pairs are bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. The bases pair in such a way that the distance
between the backbones of the two strands is the same all along the molecule.
2.4.8 Section Summary
Living things are carbon-based because carbon plays such a prominent role in the chemistry of living things.
The four covalent bonding positions of the carbon atom can give rise to a wide diversity of compounds with
many functions, accounting for the importance of carbon in living things.
Carbohydrates are a group of
macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the cell, provide structural support to many organisms,
and can be found on the surface of the cell as receptors or for cell recognition. Carbohydrates are classied as
monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides, depending on the number of monomers in the molecule.
Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature. Major types include
fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats and oils are a stored form of energy and can include
triglycerides. Fats and oils are usually made up of fatty acids and glycerol.
Proteins are a class of macromolecules that can perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They
help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers or as hormones.
The building blocks of proteins are amino acids. Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary,
tertiary, and quaternary. Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by
changes in temperature, pH, or chemical exposure may lead to protein denaturation and a loss of function.
Nucleic acids are molecules made up of repeating units of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such
as cell division and protein synthesis. Each nucleotide is made up of a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base,
and a phosphate group. There are two types of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA.

share certain fundamental characteristics. In this chapter, these characteristics will be examined in greater
detail.
3.2 Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells2
Cells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.
The predominantly single-celled
organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea are classied as prokaryotes (pro - = before; -karyon- =
nucleus). Animal cells, plant cells, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes (eu- = true).
3.2.1 Components of Prokaryotic Cells
All cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell's
interior from its surrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like region within the cell in
which other cellular components are found; 3) DNA, the genetic material of the cell; and 4) ribosomes,
particles that synthesize proteins. However, prokaryotes dier from eukaryotic cells in several ways.
A
prokaryotic cell is a simple, single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other
membrane-bound organelle.
We will shortly come to see that this is signicantly dierent in eukaryotes.
3.2.2 Eukaryotic Cells
In nature, the relationship between form and function is apparent at all levels, including the level of the
cell, and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells. The principle form follows function is found
in many contexts.
For example, birds and sh have streamlined bodies that allow them to move quickly
through the medium in which they live, be it air or water. It means that, in general, one can deduce the
function of a structure by looking at its form, because the two are matched.
A
eukaryotic cell is a cell that has a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound compartorganelles, which have specialized functions. The word eukaryotic means true kernel
ments or sacs, called
or true nucleus, alluding to the presence of the membrane-bound nucleus in these cells.
The word or-
ganelle means little organ, and, as already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just
as the organs of your body have specialized functions.
3.2.3 Cell Size
At 0.15.0 micrometers (µm; 1/1,000,000 of a meter) in diameter, prokaryotic cells are signicantly smaller
any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly move out. However, larger eukaryotic cells have
evolved dierent structural adaptations to enhance cellular transport. Indeed, the large size of these cells
would not be possible without these adaptations. In general, cell size is limited because volume increases
much more quickly than does cell surface area.
This is because volume is a cubic dimension and surface
area is a squared dimension. For example, if X=2, then the surface area (x squared) is 4 and the volume (x
cubed) is 8. If x =3, then the surface area is 9 and the volume is 27. As a cell becomes larger, it becomes
more and more dicult for the cell to acquire sucient materials to support the processes inside the cell,
because the relative size of the surface area across which materials must be transported declines.

and eukaryotic cells. Note: 1000 nanometers equals 1 micrometer, 1000 micrometers equals 1 millimeter,
and 1000 millimeters equals one meter.
3.2.4 Section Summary
Prokaryotes are predominantly single-celled organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea. All prokaryotes
have plasma membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, a cell wall, DNA, and lack membrane-bound organelles.
Many also have polysaccharide capsules. Prokaryotic cells range in diameter from 0.15.0 µm.
Like a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a
eukaryotic cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell, has a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded
by a membrane), and has other membrane-bound organelles that allow for compartmentalization of functions.
Eukaryotic cells tend to be 10 to 100 times the size of prokaryotic cells.

3.3 A More Detailed Look at Eukaryotic Cells3
At this point, it should be clear that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than do prokaryotic
cells. Organelles and other cellular components allow for various functions to occur in the cell at the same
time. Before discussing the functions of organelles within a eukaryotic cell, let us rst examine two important
components of the cell: the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm.

CHAPTER 3.

3.4: This gure shows a typical animal cell.
3.3.1 The Plasma Membrane
Like prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells have a
with embedded proteins that separates the internal contents of the cell from its surrounding environment.
A phospholipid is a lipid molecule composed of two fatty acid chains, a glycerol backbone, and a phosphate
group. The plasma membrane regulates the passage of some substances, such as organic molecules, ions, and
water, preventing the passage of some to maintain internal conditions, while actively bringing in or removing
others. Other compounds move passively across the membrane.
components, such as cholesterol and carbohydrates, which can be found in the membrane in addition to
phospholipids and protein. The phrase "uid mosaic" is used to describe the structure of the plasma
membrane because it is dynamic and contains numerous components.
The plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption are folded into ngerlike projections called
microvilli (singular = microvillus). This folding increases the surface area of the plasma membrane. Such
cells are typically found lining the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. This
is an excellent example of form matching the function of a structure.
People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley,
and rye. The immune response damages microvilli, and thus, aicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients.
This leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea.
Patients suering from celiac disease must follow a
gluten-free diet.

cytoskeleton, and various chemicals. Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a
semi-solid consistency, which comes from the proteins within it. However, proteins are not the only organic
molecules found in the cytoplasm. Glucose and other simple sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic
acids, fatty acids, and derivatives of glycerol are found there too.
Ions of sodium, potassium, calcium,
and many other elements are also dissolved in the cytoplasm. Many metabolic reactions, including protein
synthesis, take place in the cytoplasm.
3.3.3 The Endomembrane System

nuclear envelope, lysosomes, and vesicles, the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which we will cover
shortly. Although not technically within the cell, the plasma membrane is included in the endomembrane
system because, as you will see, it interacts with the other endomembranous organelles.
3.3.3.1 The Nucleus
Typically, the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell. The
nucleus (plural = nuclei) houses the
cell's DNA in the form of chromatin and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins. Let us look at it
The outermost boundary of the nucleus is the nuclear envelope.
Notice that the nu-
clear envelope consists of two phospholipid bilayers (membranes)an outer membrane and an inner
The
nuclear envelope is a double-membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the
The nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions, molecules, and RNA
between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The DNA in the nucleus is too large to t through the pores.
To understand chromatin, it is helpful to rst consider chromosomes. Chromosomes are structures within
the nucleus that are made up of DNA (the hereditary material) and proteins. This combination of DNA and
proteins is called chromatin. In eukaryotes, chromosomes are linear structures. Every species has a specic
number of chromosomes in the nucleus of its body cells. For example, in humans, the chromosome number
is 46, whereas in fruit ies, the chromosome number is eight.
Chromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to
divide. This is because the DNA condenses or compacts in preparation for cell division. When the cell is in
the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle, the chromosomes resemble an unwound, jumbled bunch
of threads and the DNA is more accessible to be used to make proteins.
We already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes, but how does it do this?
Some
chromosomes have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA. A darkly staining area within the nucleus,
called the
nucleolus (plural = nucleoli), aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble
the ribosomal subunits that are then transported through the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm.
3.3.3.2 The Endoplasmic Reticulum
The
collectively modify proteins and synthesize lipids. However, these two functions are performed in separate
areas of the endoplasmic reticulum: the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum,
respectively.
The
rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is so named because the ribosomes attached to its cyto-
plasmic surface give it a studded appearance when viewed through an electron microscope.
The ribosomes synthesize proteins while attached to the ER, resulting in transfer of their newly synthesized proteins into the lumen of the RER where they undergo modications such as folding or addition of
sugars. The RER also makes phospholipids for cell membranes.
If the phospholipids or modied proteins are not destined to stay in the RER, they will be packaged
is engaged in modifying proteins that will be secreted from the cell, it is abundant in cells that secrete
proteins, such as the liver.
The
smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes
on its cytoplasmic surface (see 3.4). The SER's functions include synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids (including
phospholipids), and steroid hormones; detoxication of medications and poisons; alcohol metabolism; and
storage of calcium ions.
3.3.3.3 The Golgi Apparatus
We have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER, but where do the vesicles go? Before reaching
their nal destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles need to be sorted, packaged, and
tagged so that they wind up in the right place. The sorting, tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and
proteins take place in the
Golgi apparatus (also called the Golgi body), a series of attened membranous

Russell)
The Golgi apparatus has a receiving face near the endoplasmic reticulum and a releasing face on the side
away from the ER, toward the cell membrane. The transport vesicles that form from the ER travel to the
receiving face, fuse with it, and empty their contents into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. As the proteins
and lipids travel through the Golgi, they undergo further modications. The most frequent modication is
the addition of short chains of sugar molecules. The newly modied proteins and lipids are then tagged with
small molecular groups to enable them to be routed to their proper destinations.
Finally, the modied and tagged proteins are packaged into vesicles that bud from the opposite face of
the Golgi. While some of these vesicles, transport vesicles, deposit their contents into other parts of the cell
where they will be used, others, secretory vesicles, fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents
outside the cell.
The amount of Golgi in dierent cell types again illustrates that form follows function within cells. Cells
that engage in a great deal of secretory activity (such as cells of the salivary glands that secrete digestive
enzymes or cells of the immune system that secrete antibodies) have an abundant number of Golgi.
3.3.3.4 Lysosomes
In animal cells, the
lysosomes are the cell's garbage disposal. Digestive enzymes within the lysosomes
aid the breakdown of proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and even worn-out organelles.
In
single-celled eukaryotes, lysosomes are important for digestion of the food they ingest and the recycling of
organelles.
These enzymes are active at a much lower pH (more acidic) than those located in the cyto-
plasm. Many reactions that take place in the cytoplasm could not occur at a low pH, thus the advantage of
compartmentalizing the eukaryotic cell into organelles is apparent.
Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to destroy disease-causing organisms that might enter the
cell. A good example of this occurs in a group of white blood cells called macrophages, which are part of
your body's immune system.
In a process known as phagocytosis, a section of the plasma membrane of
the macrophage invaginates (folds in) and engulfs a pathogen. The invaginated section, with the pathogen
inside, then pinches itself o from the plasma membrane and becomes a vesicle. The vesicle fuses with a
then fuses with a lysosome within the cell so that the pathogen can be destroyed. Other organelles are
present in the cell, but for simplicity, are not shown.
3.3.3.5 Vesicles
Vesicles are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport. Vesicles can fuse with other
membranes within the cell system.

3.3.4 Ribosomes
Ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. When viewed through an electron
microscope, free ribosomes appear as either clusters or single tiny dots oating freely in the cytoplasm.
Ribosomes may be attached to either the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or the cytoplasmic side
of the endoplasmic reticulum.
Electron microscopy has shown that ribosomes consist of large and small
subunits. Ribosomes are enzyme complexes that are responsible for protein synthesis.
Because protein synthesis is essential for all cells, ribosomes are found in practically every cell, although
they are smaller in prokaryotic cells. They are particularly abundant in immature red blood cells for the
synthesis of hemoglobin, which functions in the transport of oxygen throughout the body.
3.3.5 Mitochondria
Mitochondria (singular = mitochondrion) are often called the powerhouses or energy factories of a
cell because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy-carrying
Each membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The inner layer has folds called cristae,
which increase the surface area of the inner membrane.
The area surrounded by the folds is called the
mitochondrial matrix. The cristae and the matrix have dierent roles in cellular respiration.
In keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to point out that muscle cells have
a very high concentration of mitochondria because muscle cells need a lot of energy to contract.
3.3.6 Section Summary
Like a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a eukaryotic
cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell, has a true nucleus (meaning its DNA is surrounded by a
membrane), and has other membrane-bound organelles that allow for compartmentalization of functions.
The plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The nucleolus within the nucleus
is the site for ribosome assembly. Ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm or are attached to the cytoplasmic
side of the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum.
They perform protein synthesis.
Mitochondria
perform cellular respiration and produce ATP. Vesicles are storage and transport compartments.
The endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus,
lysosomes, vesicles, as well as the plasma membrane. These cellular components work together to modify,
package, tag, and transport membrane lipids and proteins.

3.4 A More Detailed Look At The Cell Membrane4
A cell's plasma membrane denes the boundary of the cell and determines the nature of its contact with
the environment. Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in controlled
quantities.
Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are
dynamic and constantly in ux. The plasma membrane must be suciently exible to allow certain cells,
such as red blood cells and white blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These
are the more obvious functions of a plasma membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane
carries markers that allow cells to recognize one another, which is vital as tissues and organs form during
early development, and which later plays a role in the self  versus non-self  distinction of the immune
response.
The plasma membrane also carries receptors, which are attachment sites for specic substances that
interact with the cell. Each receptor is structured to bind with a specic substance. For example, surface
receptors of the membrane create changes in the interior, such as changes in enzymes of metabolic pathways.
These metabolic pathways might be vital for providing the cell with energy, making specic substances for
the cell, or breaking down cellular waste or toxins for disposal. Receptors on the plasma membrane's exterior
surface interact with hormones or neurotransmitters, and allow their messages to be transmitted into the
cell. Some recognition sites are used by viruses as attachment points. Although they are highly specic,
pathogens like viruses may evolve to exploit receptors to gain entry to a cell by mimicking the specic
substance that the receptor is meant to bind. This specicity helps to explain why human immunodeciency
virus (HIV) or any of the ve types of hepatitis viruses invade only specic cells.
3.4.1 Fluid Mosaic Model
In 1972, S. J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson proposed a new model of the plasma membrane that, compared
to earlier understanding, better explained both microscopic observations and the function of the plasma
membrane. This was called the
uid mosaic model. The model has evolved somewhat over time, but still
best accounts for the structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them. The
uid mosaic model describes the structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of componentsincluding
phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydratesin which the components are able to ow and change
position, while maintaining the basic integrity of the membrane. Both phospholipid molecules and embedded
proteins are able to diuse rapidly and laterally in the membrane. The uidity of the plasma membrane
is necessary for the activities of certain enzymes and transport molecules within the membrane.
Plasma
membranes range from 510 nanometers (nm) thick. As a comparison, human red blood cells, visible via
light microscopy, are approximately 8 micrometers (µm) thick, or approximately 1,000 times thicker than a
as a uid combination of phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates.
The plasma membrane is made up primarily of a bilayer of phospholipids with embedded proteins,
carbohydrates, glycolipids, and glycoproteins, and, in animal cells, cholesterol. The amount of cholesterol
in animal plasma membranes regulates the uidity of the membrane and changes based on the temperature
of the cell's environment. In other words, cholesterol acts as antifreeze in the cell membrane and is more
abundant in animals that live in cold climates.
The main fabric of the membrane is composed of two layers of phospholipid molecules, and the polar ends
in contact with aqueous uid both inside and outside the cell. Thus, both surfaces of the plasma membrane
are hydrophilic.
In contrast, the interior of the membrane, between its two surfaces, is a hydrophobic or
nonpolar region because of the fatty acid tails.
This region has no attraction for water or other polar
molecules.
Proteins make up the second major chemical component of plasma membranes.
embedded in the plasma membrane and may span all or part of the membrane.
Integral proteins are
Integral proteins may
serve as channels or pumps to move materials into or out of the cell. Peripheral proteins are found on the
exterior or interior surfaces of membranes, attached either to integral proteins or to phospholipid molecules.
Both integral and peripheral proteins may serve as enzymes, as structural attachments for the bers of the
cytoskeleton, or as part of the cell's recognition sites.
CHAPTER 3.
Carbohydrates are the third major component of plasma membranes.
CELLS
They are always found on the
exterior surface of cells and are bound either to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids). These carbohydrate chains may consist of 260 monosaccharide units and may be either straight
or branched. Along with peripheral proteins, carbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that
allow cells to recognize each other.

How Viruses Infect Specic Organs
Specic glycoprotein molecules exposed on the surface of the cell membranes of host cells are
exploited by many viruses to infect specic organs.
For example, HIV is able to penetrate the
plasma membranes of specic kinds of white blood cells called T-helper cells and monocytes, as
well as some cells of the central nervous system. The hepatitis virus attacks only liver cells.
These viruses are able to invade these cells, because the cells have binding sites on their surfaces
cell is tricked by the mimicry of the virus coat molecules, and the virus is able to enter the cell.
Other recognition sites on the virus's surface interact with the human immune system, prompting
the body to produce antibodies.
Antibodies are made in response to the antigens (or proteins
associated with invasive pathogens). These same sites serve as places for antibodies to attach, and
either destroy or inhibit the activity of the virus. Unfortunately, these sites on HIV are encoded
by genes that change quickly, making the production of an eective vaccine against the virus very
dicult.
The virus population within an infected individual quickly evolves through mutation
into dierent populations, or variants, distinguished by dierences in these recognition sites. This
rapid change of viral surface markers decreases the eectiveness of the person's immune system
in attacking the virus, because the antibodies will not recognize the new variations of the surface
patterns.

3.4.2 Section Summary
The modern understanding of the plasma membrane is referred to as the uid mosaic model. The plasma
membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, with their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with
each other. The landscape of the membrane is studded with proteins, some of which span the membrane.
Some of these proteins serve to transport materials into or out of the cell. Carbohydrates are attached to
some of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing surface of the membrane. These form complexes that
function to identify the cell to other cells. The uid nature of the membrane owes itself to the conguration of
the fatty acid tails, the presence of cholesterol embedded in the membrane (in animal cells), and the mosaic

cell would no longer be able to sustain itself, and it would be destroyed. Some cells require larger amounts
of specic substances than do other cells; they must have a way of obtaining these materials from the
extracellular uids. This may happen passively, as certain materials move back and forth, or the cell may
have special mechanisms that ensure transport.
Most cells expend most of their energy, in the form of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to create and maintain an uneven distribution of ions on the opposite sides
of their membranes.
The structure of the plasma membrane contributes to these functions, but it also
presents some problems.
The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive.
Passive transport is a naturally occurring
phenomenon and does not require the cell to expend energy to accomplish the movement. In passive transport, substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration in a process
called diusion. Concentration refers to the amount of a solute in a volume of solution. The greater the
amount of solute in the volume, the higher the concentration. A physical space in which there is a dierent
concentration of a single substance is said to have a
concentration gradient. For example, if a drop of food
coloring is added to a glass of water, the place where the dye lands represents a high solute concentration
and the rest of the water represents a low solute concentration. Over time, the dye will passively move via
diusion until the concentration is equal throughout the water.
3.5.1 Selective Permeability
Recall that plasma membranes have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.
This characteristic helps the
movement of certain materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. Lipid-soluble
material can easily slip through the hydrophobic lipid core of the membrane. Substances such as the fatsoluble vitamins A, D, E, and K readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other
tissues. Fat-soluble drugs also gain easy entry into cells and are readily transported into the body's tissues
and organs. Molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which are relative small and nonpolar, pass through
by simple diusion.
Polar substances, with the exception of water, present problems for the membrane. While some polar
molecules connect easily with the outside of a cell, they cannot readily pass through the lipid core of the
plasma membrane. Additionally, whereas small ions could easily slip through the spaces in the mosaic of the
membrane, their charge prevents them from doing so. Ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride
must have a special means of penetrating plasma membranes. Simple sugars and amino acids also need help
with transport across plasma membranes.
3.5.2 Diusion
Diusion is a passive process of transport. A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across the space. You are familiar
with diusion of substances through the air. For example, think about someone opening a bottle of perfume
in a room lled with people. The perfume is at its highest concentration in the bottle and is at its lowest at
the edges of the room. The perfume vapor will diuse, or spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more
and more people will smell the perfume as it spreads. Materials move within the cell's cytosol by diusion,
energy. Rather the dierent concentrations of materials in dierent areas are a form of potential energy, and
diusion is the dissipation of that potential energy as materials move down their concentration gradients,
from high to low.
CHAPTER 3.
CELLS
Diusion through a permeable membrane follows the concentration gradient of a sub-
stance, moving the substance from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration. When the
concentrations are equal on both sides of the membrane, a concentration gradient no longer exists and
Ruiz Villarreal)
Each separate substance in a medium, such as the extracellular uid, has its own concentration gradient,
independent of the concentration gradients of other materials.
Additionally, each substance will diuse
according to that gradient.
Several factors aect the rate of diusion:
•
Extent of the concentration gradient: The greater the dierence in concentration, the more rapid the
diusion. The closer the distribution of the material gets to equal on both sides, the slower the rate of
diusion becomes.
•
Mass of the molecules diusing: More massive molecules move more slowly, because it is more dicult
for them to move between the molecules of the substance they are moving through; therefore, they
diuse more slowly.
•
Temperature: Higher temperatures increase the energy and therefore the movement of the molecules,
increasing the rate of diusion.

3.5.3 Facilitated transport
In
facilitated transport, also called facilitated diusion, material moves across the plasma membrane with
the assistance of transmembrane proteins down a concentration gradient (from high to low concentration)
without the expenditure of cellular energy. However, the substances that undergo facilitated transport would
otherwise not diuse easily or quickly across the plasma membrane. The solution to moving polar substances
and other substances across the plasma membrane rests in the proteins that span its surface. The material
being transported is rst attached to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the exterior surface of the plasma
membrane. This allows the material that is needed by the cell to be removed from the extracellular uid.
The substances are then passed to specic integral proteins that facilitate their passage, because they form
channels or pores that allow certain substances to pass through the membrane. The integral proteins involved
in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins, and they function as either channels
for the material or carriers.
3.5.4 Osmosis
Osmosis is the diusion of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane. Whereas diusion transports material across membranes and within
cells, osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diusion of solutes in
the water. Osmosis is a special case of diusion. Water, like other substances, moves from an area of higher
concentration to one of lower concentration. Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane, separating
On both sides of the membrane, the water level is the same, but
there are dierent concentrations on each side of a dissolved substance, or
solute, that cannot cross the
membrane. If the volume of the water is the same, but the concentrations of solute are dierent, then there
are also dierent concentrations of water, the solvent, on either side of the membrane.

membrane due to its size.
A principle of diusion is that the molecules move around and will spread evenly throughout the medium
if they can.
it.
However, only the material capable of getting through the membrane will diuse through
In this example, the solute cannot diuse through the membrane, but the water can.
Water has a
concentration gradient in this system. Therefore, water will diuse down its concentration gradient, crossing
the membrane to the side where it is less concentrated. This diusion of water through the membrane
osmosiswill continue until the concentration gradient of water goes to zero. Osmosis proceeds constantly

3.5.5 Tonicity
Tonicity describes the amount of solute in a solution. Three termshypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic
are used to relate the concentration of solutes inside of a cell compared to the concentration of solutes in
the uid that contains the cells. In a
hypotonic solution, such as tap water, the extracellular uid has a
lower concentration of solutes than the uid inside the cell, and water enters the cell. (In living systems, the
point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so the prex hypo - means that the extracellular uid has a lower
concentration of solutes, than the cell cytoplasm.) It also means that the extracellular uid has a higher
concentration of water than does the cell. In this situation, water will follow its concentration gradient and
enter the cell. This may cause an animal cell to burst, or lyse. Note in these cases that there is always a net
movement of water (the solvent) towards the hypertonic solution by the process of osmosis. That is because
the hypertonic solution has a lower concentration of water and the solute can't pass through the membrane.
In a
hypertonic solution (the prex hyper - refers to the extracellular uid having a higher concentration
of solutes than the cell's cytoplasm), the uid contains less water than the cell does, such as seawater. Because
the cell has a lower concentration of solutes, the water will leave the cell. In eect, the solute is drawing the
water out of the cell. This may cause an animal cell to shrivel, or crenate.
In an
isotonic solution, the extracellular uid has the same osmolarity as the cell. If the concentration of
solutes of the cell matches that of the extracellular uid, there will be no net movement of water into or out
of the cell. Blood cells in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions take on characteristic appearances
:
tonic solutions. Note the tonicity terms refer to the solution containing the cells versus the solution inside
the cell. If a cell is immersed in a hypotonic solution, then the contents of the cell are hypertonic and
3.5.6 Section Summary
The passive forms of transport, diusion and osmosis, move material of small molecular weight. Substances
diuse from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, and this process continues until the
substance is evenly distributed in a system. In solutions of more than one substance, each type of molecule
diuses according to its own concentration gradient. Many factors can aect the rate of diusion, including
concentration gradient, the sizes of the particles that are diusing, and the temperature of the system.
In living systems, diusion of substances into and out of cells is mediated by the plasma membrane.
Some materials diuse readily through the membrane, but others are hindered, and their passage is only
made possible by protein channels and carriers. The chemistry of living things occurs in aqueous solutions,

and balancing the concentrations of those solutions is an ongoing problem. In living systems, diusion of
some substances would be slow or dicult without membrane proteins.
3.5.8 Multiple Choice
3.6 Active Transport Mechanisms8
Active transport mechanisms require the use of the cell's energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient, that is, if the concentration of the substance inside the cell must be greater than its concentration in the extracellular uid,
the cell must use energy to move the substance. Some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular
weight material, such as ions, through the membrane.
In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take
in larger molecules and particles. Some cells are even capable of engulng entire unicellular microorganisms.
You might have correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires
energy. A large particle, however, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell.
3.6.1 Primary Active Transport
There are several types of active transport.
The principle one that will be discussed is primary active
transport, which uses a combination of ATP energy and a transport protein to move substances across the
membrane against the concentration gradient.
ATP is hydrolyzed, via an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, to
ADP and the lost phosphate group attaches to the protein. This joining causes a conformational change in
the shape of the transport protein and the particular substance is moved across the membrane against the
concentration gradient. An example of primary active transport is the sodium-potassium pump, which is
involved in nerve impulses and is discussed in a later chapter.
3.6.2 Endocytosis
Endocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells,
and even whole cells, into a cell.
There are dierent variations of endocytosis, but all share a common
characteristic: The plasma membrane of the cell invaginates, forming a pocket around the target particle.
The pocket pinches o, resulting in the particle being contained in a newly created vacuole that is formed
from the plasma membrane.
the cell membrane surrounds the particle and pinches o to form an intracellular vacuole. (b) In another
type of endocytosis, pinocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds a small volume of uid and pinches o,
forming a vesicle. (c) In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the cell is targeted to a

Phagocytosis is the process by which large particles, such as cells, are taken in by a cell. For example,

3.6.3 Exocytosis
In contrast to these methods of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis.
Exocytosis is
the opposite of the processes discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into
the extracellular uid. A particle enveloped in membrane fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane.
This fusion opens the membranous envelope to the exterior of the cell, and the particle is expelled into the
3.6.4 Section Summary
Primary active transport uses energy stored in ATP to fuel the transport. Active transport of small molecularsize material uses integral proteins in the cell membrane to move the materialthese proteins are analogous
to pumps. Some pumps, which carry out primary active transport, couple directly with ATP to drive their
action.
Endocytosis methods require the direct use of ATP to fuel the transport of large particles such as
macromolecules; parts of cells or whole cells can be engulfed by other cells in a process called phagocytosis.
In phagocytosis, a portion of the membrane invaginates and ows around the particle, eventually pinching o
and leaving the particle wholly enclosed by an envelope of plasma membrane. The cell expels waste and other
particles through the reverse process, exocytosis. Wastes are moved outside the cell, pushing a membranous
vesicle to the plasma membrane, allowing the vesicle to fuse with the membrane and incorporating itself into
the membrane structure, releasing its contents to the exterior of the cell.

that involved transfer of the nucleus from an adult udder cell to an unfertilized egg whose nucleus had
been removed. This egg was then transplanted into another female sheep to undergo development during
pregnancy.
Sheep, as well as humans, normally begin life as a single cell called a fertilized egg or zygote. From this one
cell, trillions of cells will ultimately be derived through the process of cell division. Prior to each cell division
event, the DNA must replicate. Also, cells must produce proteins needed to accomplish specic functions.
CHAPTER 4.
DNA AND GENE EXPRESSION
These events are described by the central dogma of molecular biology, which states that DNA contains
information to replicate itself and that specic regions of the DNA (called genes) contains the information
needed to make RNA, which is in turn used to produce needed proteins. In this chapter, we will learn more
about the steps of these processes.
4.2 DNA and RNA2
In the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together at the University of Cambridge, England,
to determine the structure of DNA. Other scientists, such as Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins, were
also actively exploring this eld.
Pauling had discovered the secondary structure of proteins using X-ray
crystallography. X-ray crystallography is a method for investigating molecular structure by observing the
patterns formed by X-rays shot through a crystal of the substance. The patterns give important information
about the structure of the molecule of interest.
In Wilkins' lab, researcher Rosalind Franklin was using
X-ray crystallography to understand the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick were able to piece together
of information available from other researchers such as Charga 's rules.
Charga had shown that of the
four kinds of monomers (nucleotides) present in a DNA molecule, two types were always present in equal
amounts and the remaining two types were also always present in equal amounts. This meant they were
always paired in some way. In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the
Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work in determining the structure of DNA.

Now let's consider the structure of the two types of nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and
ribonucleic acid (RNA). The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides, which are made up of three parts: a
deoxyribose (a 5-carbon sugar with the carbons designated as 1', 2', 3', 4' and 5'), a phosphate group
types of nitrogenous bases in DNA. Adenine (A) and guanine (G) are double-ringed purines, and cytosine

the ve carbon atoms in the sugar are not shown to simplify the diagram; each point on the ring is where

adjacent to an oxygen of the phosphate group. (b) Cytosine and thymine are pyrimidines. Guanine and
adenine are purines. Note: As the 2' carbon is attached to an -OH group, the sugar shown is actually
ribose, not deoxyribose as intended.
The phosphate group of one nucleotide bonds covalently with the sugar molecule of the next nucleotide,
and so on, forming a long polymer of nucleotide monomers.
The sugarphosphate groups line up in a
backbone for each single strand of DNA, and the nucleotide bases stick out from this backbone.
The
carbon atoms of the ve-carbon sugar are numbered clockwise from the oxygen as 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5' (1' is
read as one prime). The phosphate group is attached to the 5' carbon of one nucleotide and the 3' carbon
of the next nucleotide. In its natural state, each DNA molecule is actually composed of two single strands
held together along their length with hydrogen bonds between the bases.
Watson and Crick proposed that the DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to
form a right-handed helix, called a
double helix. Base-pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine:
namely, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. In other words, adenine and thymine are complementary base
pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. This is the basis for Charga 's rule;
because of their complementarity, there is as much adenine as thymine in a DNA molecule and as much
guanine as cytosine. Adenine and thymine are connected by two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine and guanine
are connected by three hydrogen bonds. The two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, one strand will
have the 3' carbon of the sugar in the upward position, whereas the other strand will have the 5' carbon
in the upward position. The diameter of the DNA double helix is uniform throughout because a purine (two

There is a second nucleic acid in all cells called ribonucleic acid, or RNA. Like DNA, RNA is a polymer
of nucleotides. Each of the nucleotides in RNA is made up of a nitrogenous base, a ve-carbon sugar, and
a phosphate group.
In the case of RNA, the ve-carbon sugar is ribose, not deoxyribose.
Ribose has a
ribose has a hydroxyl group at the 2' carbon.
RNA nucleotides contain the nitrogenous bases adenine, cytosine, and guanine. However, they do not
contain thymine, which is instead replaced by uracil, symbolized by a U. RNA exists as a single-stranded
molecule rather than a double-stranded helix. Molecular biologists have named several kinds of RNA on the
basis of their function. These include messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA
(rRNA)molecules that are involved in the production of proteins from the DNA code.
4.2.2 How DNA Is Arranged in the Cell
DNA is a working molecule; it must be replicated when a cell is ready to divide, and it must be read to
produce the molecules, such as proteins, to carry out the functions of the cell. For this reason, the DNA
is protected and packaged in very specic ways. In addition, DNA molecules can be very long. Stretched
end-to-end, the DNA molecules in a single human cell would come to a length of about 2 meters,or 6.5 feet.
Thus, the DNA for a cell must be packaged in a very ordered way to t and function within a structure (the
cell) that is not visible to the naked eye. The chromosomes of prokaryotes are much simpler than those of
that is found in an area in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.
CHAPTER 4.
DNA AND GENE EXPRESSION
in the cytoplasm in an area called the nucleoid.
The size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes, Escherichia coli, is 4.6 million base
pairs, which would extend a distance of about 1.6 millimeters (0.06 inches) if stretched out. So how does
this t inside a small bacterial cell?
The DNA is twisted beyond the double helix in what is known as
supercoiling. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes help
in maintaining the supercoiled structure.
Eukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a dierent type of packing
proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. The DNA is wrapped tightly around the
histone core. This nucleosome is linked to the next one by a short strand of DNA that is free of histones.
This is also known as the beads on a string structure; the nucleosomes are the beads and the short
lengths of DNA between them are the string. The nucleosomes, with their DNA coiled around them, stack
compactly onto each other to form a 30-nanometerswide ber. This ber is further coiled into a thicker
and more compact structure. At the metaphase stage of mitosis, when the chromosomes are lined up in the
center of the cell, the chromosomes are at their most compacted. They are approximately 700 nanometers
in width, and are found in association with scaold proteins.
In interphase, the phase of the cell cycle between mitoses at which the chromosomes are decondensed,
eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. There is a tightly
packaged region that stains darkly, and a less dense region. The darkly staining regions usually contain genes
that are not active, and are found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The lightly staining regions
usually contain genes that are active, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.

4.2.3 Section Summary
The model of the double-helix structure of DNA was proposed by Watson and Crick. The DNA molecule is a
polymer of nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogenous base, a ve-carbon sugar (deoxyribose),
and a phosphate group. There are four nitrogenous bases in DNA, two purines (adenine and guanine) and two
pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine). A DNA molecule is composed of two strands. Each strand is composed
of nucleotides bonded together covalently between the phosphate group of one and the deoxyribose sugar of
the next. From this backbone extend the bases. The bases of one strand bond to the bases of the second
strand with hydrogen bonds. Adenine always bonds with thymine, and cytosine always bonds with guanine.
The bonding causes the two strands to spiral around each other in a shape called a double helix. Ribonucleic
acid (RNA) is a second nucleic acid found in cells. RNA is a single-stranded polymer of nucleotides. It also
diers from DNA in that it contains the sugar ribose, rather than deoxyribose, and the nucleotide uracil
rather than thymine. Various RNA molecules function in the process of forming proteins from the genetic
code in DNA.
Eukaryotes contain double-stranded linear DNA molecules packaged into chromosomes. The DNA helix
is wrapped around proteins to form nucleosomes. The protein coils are further coiled, and during mitosis
and meiosis, the chromosomes become even more greatly coiled to facilitate their movement.

4.3 The Basics of DNA Replication4
When a cell divides, it is important that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the DNA. This is
accomplished by the process of DNA replication. The replication of DNA occurs during the synthesis phase,
or S phase, of the cell cycle, before the cell enters mitosis or meiosis.
The elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA is copied. Recall
that adenine nucleotides pair with thymine nucleotides, and cytosine with guanine.
This means that the
two strands are complementary to each other. For example, a strand of DNA with a nucleotide sequence of
CHAPTER 4.
DNA AND GENE EXPRESSION
can be used to create the correct sequence of bases in the other strand.
Because of the complementarity of the two strands, having one strand means that it is possible to
recreate the other strand.
This model for replication suggests that the two strands of the double helix
separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand
strands, and blue indicates newly synthesized DNA.
During DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from
which new strands are copied. The name of the enzyme that copies the DNA is called DNA polymerase.
It joins the complementary nucleotides together to make up the new strand, which is complementary to
the parental or old strand. Each new double helix consists of one parental strand and one new daughter
strand. This is known as
semiconservative replication. When two DNA copies are formed, they have an
identical sequence of nucleotide bases and are divided equally into two daughter cells during cell division.
Therefore, each of the two daughter cells has a complete copy of each chromosome.
4.3.1 DNA Repair
DNA polymerase can sometimes make an error by inserting a noncomplementary base during DNA replication. Most mistakes are quickly corrected; if they are not, they may result in a
mutationdened as
a permanent change in the DNA sequence. Mutations in genes may lead to serious consequences because
CHAPTER 4.

DNA replicates by a semi-conservative method in which each of the two parental DNA strands act as a
template for new DNA to be synthesized. After replication, each DNA has one parental or old strand, and
one daughter or new strand.
4.3.3 Multiple Choice
4.4 Transcription5
The second function of DNA (the rst was replication) is to provide the information needed to construct
the proteins necessary so that the cell can perform all of its functions. To do this, the DNA is read or
transcribed into an
mRNA molecule. The mRNA then provides the code to form a protein by a process
called translation. Through the processes of transcription and translation, a protein is built with a specic
sequence of amino acids that was originally encoded in the DNA. This module discusses the details of
transcription.
4.4.1 The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: DNA Encodes RNA; RNA
Encodes Protein
The ow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the central dogma
of proteins.
The central dogma of molecular biology states that DNA encodes RNA, which in turn
encodes protein.
The copying of DNA to mRNA (i.e. transcription) is relatively straightforward, with one nucleotide being
added to the mRNA strand for every complementary nucleotide read in the DNA strand. The translation
to protein is more complex because groups of three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid of the
protein sequence. However, as we shall see in the next module, the translation to protein is still systematic,
such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and
so on. The groups of three nucleotides that specify an amino acid are called codons.
4.4.2 Transcription: from DNA to mRNA
With the genes bound in the nucleus, transcription occurs in the nucleus of the cell and the mRNA transcript
must be transported to the cytoplasm. Transcription occurs in three main stages: initiation, elongation, and
termination.
4.4.2.1 Initiation
Transcription requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis.

enzymes involved in transcription bind to initiate the process is called a promoter. In most cases, promoters

determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all of the time, some of the time, or hardly at all
CHAPTER 4.
DNA AND GENE EXPRESSION
The initiation of transcription begins when DNA is unwound, forming a transcription
bubble. Enzymes and other proteins involved in transcription bind at the promoter.
4.4.2.2 Elongation
Transcription always proceeds from one of the two DNA strands, which is called the
template strand.
The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA
strand, called the
nontemplate strand, with the exception that RNA contains a uracil (U) in place of
RNA polymerase proceeds along
the thymine (T) found in DNA. During elongation, an enzyme called
the DNA template adding nucleotides by base pairing with the DNA template in a manner similar to DNA
replication, with the dierence that an RNA strand is being synthesized that does not remain bound to
the DNA template. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the enzyme and
in the 5' to 3' direction, and unwinds then rewinds the DNA as it is read.
4.4.2.3 Termination
Once a gene is transcribed, the RNA polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the DNA template
and liberate the newly made mRNA. Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of
termination signals, but both involve repeated nucleotide sequences in the DNA template that result in
RNA polymerase stalling, leaving the DNA template, and freeing the mRNA transcript.
4.4.3 Eukaryotic RNA Processing
The newly transcribed eukaryotic mRNAs must undergo several processing steps before they can be transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and translated into a protein.
The mRNA transcript is rst coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins to prevent it from degrading while it
is processed and exported out of the nucleus.
This occurs while the pre-mRNA still is being synthesized
by adding a special nucleotide cap to the 5' end of the growing transcript.
In addition to preventing
degradation, factors involved in protein synthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes.
Once elongation is complete, an enzyme then adds a string of approximately 200 adenine residues to
the 3' end, called the poly-A tail. This modication further protects the pre-mRNA from degradation and
signals to cellular factors that the transcript needs to be exported to the cytoplasm.
exons (ex-on signies that they are

removed from the pre-mRNA during processing.
Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional
proteins. It is essential that all of a pre-mRNA's introns be completely and precisely removed before protein
synthesis so that the exons join together to code for the correct amino acids. If the process errs by even
a single nucleotide, the sequence of the rejoined exons would be shifted, and the resulting protein would
be nonfunctional. The process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called

4.4.4 Section Summary
mRNA synthesis is initiated at a promoter sequence on the DNA template.
Elongation synthesizes new
mRNA (called a pre-mRNA). Termination liberates the mRNA and occurs by mechanisms that stall the
RNA polymerase and cause it to fall o the DNA template. Newly transcribed mRNAs are modied with
a cap and a poly-A tail. These structures protect the mature mRNA from degradation and help export it
from the nucleus. mRNAs also undergo splicing, in which introns are removed and exons are reconnected
with single-nucleotide accuracy. Only nished mRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

4.5 Translation6
The synthesis of proteins is one of a cell's most energy-consuming metabolic processes.
In turn, proteins
account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and
proteins perform a wide variety of the functions of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis,
involves decoding an mRNA message into a polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently strung together
in lengths ranging from approximately 50 amino acids to more than 1,000.
4.5.1 The Protein Synthesis Machinery
In addition to the mRNA template, many other molecules contribute to the process of translation.
The
composition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of dierent
numbers of ribosomal RNAs (
rRNA) and polypeptides depending on the organism. However, the general
structures and functions of the protein synthesis machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells.
Translation requires the input of an mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors
CHAPTER 4.
DNA AND GENE EXPRESSION
Ribosomes are located in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes. Ribosomes are made
up of a large and a small subunit that come together for translation. The small subunit is responsible for
binding the mRNA template, whereas the large subunit sequentially binds
tRNAs, a type of RNA molecule
that brings amino acids to the growing chain of the polypeptide. Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously
translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same direction.
Depending on the species, 40 to 60 types of tRNA exist in the cytoplasm. Serving as adaptors, specic
tRNAs bind to sequences on the mRNA template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide
chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that actually translate the language of RNA into the language
of proteins. For each tRNA to function, it must have its specic amino acid bonded to it. In the process of
tRNA charging, each tRNA molecule is bonded to its correct amino acid.
4.5.2 The Genetic Code
To summarize what we know to this point, the cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA
(mRNA), a mobile molecular copy of one or more genes with an alphabet of A, C, G, and uracil (U).
Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product.
Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein
alphabet consists of 20 letters. Each amino acid is dened by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet
codon. The relationship between a nucleotide codon and its corresponding amino acid is called the genetic
code.
Given the dierent numbers of letters in the mRNA and protein alphabets, combinations of nucleotides
corresponded to single amino acids. Using a three-nucleotide code means that there are a total of 64 (4 ×
4 × 4) possible combinations; therefore, a given amino acid is encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet
This gure shows the genetic code for translating each nucleotide triplet, or codon, in

Three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation

stop codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In

addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as the
The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5' end of the mRNA. The genetic
code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis,
which is powerful evidence that all life on Earth shares a common origin.
4.5.3 The Mechanism of Protein Synthesis
Just as with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and
termination.
Protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. This complex involves the small
ribosome subunit, the mRNA template,and a tRNA that interacts with the AUG start codon, and is linked
to the amino acid methionine.
In polypeptide elongation the large ribosomal subunit consists of three compartments: P, A, and E sites.
The A site binds incoming charged tRNAs (tRNAs with their attached specic amino acids). The P site
binds charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that have formed bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but
have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA. The E site releases dissociated tRNAs so they can

occurs in the three sites. With each step, a charged tRNA enters the complex, the polypeptide becomes one
amino acid longer, and an uncharged tRNA departs.
ribosomal subunit joins the small subunit, and a second tRNA is recruited. As the mRNA moves relative
to the ribosome, the polypeptide chain is formed. Entry of a release factor into the A site terminates
translation and the components dissociate.
CHAPTER 4.
DNA AND GENE EXPRESSION
Termination of translation occurs when a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered.
When
the ribosome encounters the stop codon, the growing polypeptide is released and the ribosome subunits
dissociate and leave the mRNA. After many ribosomes have completed translation, the mRNA is degraded
so the nucleotides can be reused in another transcription reaction.

4.5.4 Section Summary
The central dogma describes the ow of genetic information in the cell from genes to mRNA to proteins.
Genes are used to make mRNA by the process of transcription; mRNA is used to synthesize proteins by the
process of translation. The genetic code is the correspondence between the three-nucleotide mRNA codon
and an amino acid. The genetic code is translated by the tRNA molecules, which associate a specic codon
with a specic amino acid. The genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in mRNA specify only
20 amino acids and three stop codons. This means that more than one codon corresponds to an amino acid.
Almost every species on the planet uses the same genetic code.
The players in translation include the mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors.
The small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA template. Translation begins at the initiating AUG on
the mRNA. The formation of bonds occurs between sequential amino acids specied by the mRNA template
according to the genetic code. The ribosome accepts charged tRNAs, and as it steps along the mRNA, it
catalyzes bonding between the new amino acid and the end of the growing polypeptide. The entire mRNA
is translated in three-nucleotide steps of the ribosome. When a stop codon is encountered, a release factor
binds and dissociates the components and frees the new protein.

5.1 Homeostasis1
Before moving on to discussing organ systems, it is important to review the concept of internal balance.
Homeostasis refers to the relatively stable state inside the body. Human organs and organ systems constantly
adjust to internal and external changes in order to maintain this steady state. Examples of internal conditions
maintained homeostatically are the level of blood glucose, body temperature, and blood calcium level. These
conditions remain stable because of physiologic processes that result in negative feedback relationships. If the
blood glucose or calcium rises, this sends a signal to organs responsible for lowering blood glucose or calcium.
The signals that restore the normal levels are examples of negative feedback. When homeostatic mechanisms
fail, the results can be unfavorable.
Homeostatic mechanisms keep the body in dynamic equilibrium by
constantly adjusting to the changes that the body's systems encounter.
Even when a person is inactive,
he/she is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium. An examples of a factor that is regulated homeostatically
is body temperature in a process called thermoregulation.
5.1.1 Homeostasis
The goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a specic value of some aspect of the body
or its cells called a
set point. While there are normal uctuations from the set point, the body's systems
will usually attempt to go back to this point. A change in the internal or external environment is called a
stimulus and is detected by a receptor; the response of the system is to adjust the activities of the system
so the value moves back toward the set point. For instance, if the body becomes too warm, adjustments are
made to cool it. If glucose levels in the blood rise after a meal, adjustments are made to lower them and to
get the nutrient into tissues that need it or to store it for later use.
When a change occurs in an animal's environment, an adjustment must be made so that the internal
environment of the body and cells remains stable. The receptor that senses the change in the environment
is part of a feedback mechanism.
The stimulustemperature, glucose, or calcium levelsis detected by
the receptor. The receptor sends information to a control center, often the brain, which relays appropriate
signals to an eector organ that is able to cause an appropriate change, either up or down, depending on
the information the sensor was sending.
5.1.2 Thermoregulation
Animals, such as humans, that maintain a constant body temperature in the face of diering environmental
temperatures, are called
endotherms. We are able to maintain this temperature by generating internal
CHAPTER 5.
DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
heat (a waste product of the cellular chemical reactions of metabolism) that keeps the cellular processes
operating optimally even when the environment is cold.
Endotherms use their circulatory systems to help maintain body temperature. Vasodilation, the opening
up of arteries to the skin by relaxation of their smooth muscles, brings more blood and heat to the body
surface, facilitating radiation and evaporative heat loss, cooling the body. Vasoconstriction, the narrowing
of blood vessels to the skin by contraction of their smooth muscles, reduces blood ow in peripheral blood
vessels, forcing blood toward the core and vital organs, conserving heat.
The processes of temperature
control are centered in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus maintains the set
point for body temperature through reexes that cause vasodilation or vasoconstriction and shivering or
sweating. The hypothalamus directs the responses that eect the changes in temperature loss or gain that
return the body to the set point. The set point may be adjusted in some instances. During an infection,
compounds called pyrogens are produced and circulate to the hypothalamus resetting the thermostat to a
higher value. This allows the body's temperature to increase to a new homeostatic equilibrium point in what
is commonly called a fever. The increase in body heat makes the body less optimal for bacterial growth and
increases the activities of cells so they are better able to ght the infection.
:
5.1.3 Section Summary
Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium that is maintained in body tissues and organs. It is dynamic because
it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the systems encounter.
It is an equilibrium because body
functions are kept within a normal range, with some uctuations around a set point.
5.2 The Digestive System2
All living organisms need nutrients to survive. While plants can obtain nutrients from their roots and the
energy molecules required for cellular function through the process of photosynthesis, animals obtain their
nutrients by the consumption of other organisms. At the cellular level, the biological molecules necessary
for animal function are amino acids, lipid molecules, nucleotides, and simple sugars.
However, the food
consumed consists of protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates. Animals must convert these macromolecules
into the simple molecules required for maintaining cellular function. The conversion of the food consumed
to the nutrients required is a multistep process involving digestion and absorption. During digestion, food
particles are broken down to smaller components, which are later absorbed by the body. This happens by
both physical means, such as chewing, and by chemical means, via enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
One of the challenges in human nutrition is maintaining a balance between food intake, storage, and
energy expenditure. Taking in more food energy than is used in activity leads to storage of the excess in the
form of fat deposits. The rise in obesity and the resulting diseases like type 2 diabetes makes understanding
the role of diet and nutrition in maintaining good health all the more important.

food (starch and fats, respectively). The food is then swallowed and enters the
that connects the mouth to the stomach. Using
muscles of the esophagus push the food toward the stomach. The stomach contents are extremely acidic,
with a pH between 1.5 and 2.5. This acidity kills microorganisms, breaks down food tissues, and activates
digestive enzymes. Further breakdown of food takes place in the small intestine where bile produced by the
liver, and enzymes produced by the small intestine and the pancreas, continue the process of digestion. The
smaller molecules are absorbed into the blood stream through the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small
intestine. The waste material travels on to the large intestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste
material is compacted into feces; it is stored in the rectum until it is excreted through the anus.
includes the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. The accessory
organs are those that indirectly join to this tube via ducts and include the salivary glands, liver, gall
bladder, and pancreas.
CHAPTER 5.
DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
5.2.1.1 Oral Cavity
Both physical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth or
oral cavity, which is the point of entry of food
into the digestive system. The food is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of
the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food to begin the process of physically breaking it
down into smaller particles.
The chemical process of digestion begins during chewing as food mixes with saliva, produced by the
Saliva also contains lysozyme, which has antibacterial action.
It also contains an enzyme called salivary
amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose.
Another enzyme called lipase is produced by cells in the tongue to break down fats. The chewing and
wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the bolus for swallowing.
The tongue helps in swallowingmoving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx. The pharynx opens
to two passageways: the esophagus and the trachea. The esophagus leads to the stomach and the trachea
leads to the lungs. The epiglottis is a ap of tissue that covers the tracheal opening during swallowing to
prevent food from entering the lungs.
by saliva secreted from the salivary glands.
Enzymes in the saliva begin to digest starches and fats.
With the help of the tongue, the resulting bolus is moved into the esophagus by swallowing.

the bolus) passes through the esophagus after being swallowed.
The chewed and softened
The smooth muscles of the
esophagus undergo peristalsis (contractions) that pushes the food toward the stomach. The peristaltic wave
is unidirectionalit moves food from the mouth the stomach, and reverse movement is not possible, except
in the case of the vomit reex. The peristaltic movement of the esophagus is an involuntary reex; it takes
place in response to the act of swallowing and you don't exert conscious control over it.
Ring-like muscles called sphincters form valves in the digestive system. The gastro-esophageal sphincter
(a.k.a. lower esophageal or cardiac sphincter) is located at the stomach end of the esophagus. In response
to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter opens, and the bolus enters the
stomach. When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the stomach
from traveling up the esophagus. Acid reux or heartburn occurs when the acidic digestive juices escape
back into the esophagus and the low pH irritates the unprotected surface. Prolonged and repeated exposure
of the esophagus to this acidity can cause physical damage.

Protein digestion is carried out by an enzyme called
stomach is a saclike organ that
pepsin in the stomach chamber. The highly acidic
environment kills many microorganisms in the food and, combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin,
results in the catabolism of protein in the food. Chemical digestion is facilitated by the churning action of
the stomach caused by contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles. The partially digested food and gastric
juice mixture is called
chyme. Gastric emptying occurs within two to six hours after a meal. Only a small
amount of chyme is released into the small intestine at a time. The movement of chyme from the stomach
into the small intestine is regulated by hormones, stomach distension and muscular reexes that inuence
the pyloric sphincter. The low pH of the stomach will denature the amylase and lipase that were secreted in
the mouth. Therefore, over time, chemical digestion of starches and fats will decrease in the stomach.
The stomach lining is unaected by pepsin and the acidity because pepsin is released in an inactive form
(pepsinogen) that is activated by the low pH. The stomach also has a thick mucus lining that protects the
underlying tissue.
5.2.1.4 Small Intestine
Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. The

small intestine is the organ where the digestion
The small intestine is a long tube-like organ with a
highly folded surface containing nger-like projections called the villi.
The top surface of each villus has
many microscopic projections called microvilli. The epithelial cells at the surface of these structures absorb
nutrients from the digested food and release them to the bloodstream on the other side. Methods of transport
previously discussed (e.g.active transport)are used during this movement. The villi and microvilli, with their
many folds, increase the surface area of the small intestine and increase absorption eciency of the nutrients.
The human small intestine is over 6 m (19.6 ft) long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum,
the jejunum and the ileum. The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter. The
chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices, an alkaline/basic solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the
acidity of chyme from the stomach. This result raises the pH and creates an environment that is appropriate
for enzymes. Pancreatic juices contain several digestive enzymes (amylase, trypsin, and lipase) that break
down starches, proteins, and fats, respectively.
Bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated
in the gallbladder; it enters the duodenum through the bile duct.
Bile contains bile salts, which make
lipids accessible to the water-soluble enzymes. This is accomplished via a process called emulsication, a
type of physical digestion.
Bile keeps fat droplets from coming back together again, thus increasing the
surface area available to lipase.
The wall of the small intestines secrete disaccharidases, which faciltate
digestion of disaccharides (e.g. maltose, sucrose, and lactose) into their respective monosaccharides. The
monosaccharides, amino acids, bile salts, vitamins, and other nutrients are absorbed by the cells of the
intestinal lining.
The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements. The ileum ends and
the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve.
The vermiform, worm-like, appendix is located at the
ileocecal valve. The appendix of humans has a minor role in immunity.
CHAPTER 5.

5.2.1.5 Large Intestine
The
large intestine reabsorbs the water from indigestible food material and processes the waste material
in diameter. It has three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum joins the ileum to the
colon and is the receiving pouch for the waste matter. The colon is home to many bacteria or intestinal
ora that aid in the digestive processes. The
colon has four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse
colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. The main functions of the colon are to extract the water
and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material.

The organic molecules required for building cellular material and tissues must come from food.
During
digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately broken down into glucose and used to provide energy
within the cells of the body. Complex carbohydrates, including polysaccharides, can be broken down into
glucose through biochemical modication; however, humans do not produce the enzyme necessary to digest
cellulose (ber). The intestinal ora in the human gut are able to extract some nutrition from these plant
bers.
These plant bers are known as dietary ber and are an important component of the diet.
The
excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen and stored for later use in the liver and muscle tissue.
Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance running, and to provide energy
during food shortage. Fats are stored under the skin of mammals for insulation and energy reserves.
Proteins in food are broken down during digestion and the resulting amino acids are absorbed. All of the
proteins in the body must be formed from these amino-acid constituents; no proteins are obtained directly
from food.
Fats add avor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness. Fatty foods are also signicant sources
of energy, and fatty acids are required for the construction of lipid membranes. Fats are also required in the
diet to aid the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones.
While the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from precursors, there
are some nutrients that must be obtained from food.
These nutrients are termed
essential nutrients,
meaning they must be eaten, because the body cannot produce them. Essential nutrients include some fatty
acids, some amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.
5.2.3 Section Summary
There are many organs that work together to digest food and absorb nutrients. The mouth is the point of
ingestion and the location where both mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. Saliva contains an
enzyme called amylase that breaks down carbohydrates and an enxyme lipase that breaks down triglycerides.
The food bolus travels through the esophagus by peristaltic movements to the stomach. The stomach has
an extremely acidic environment. The enzyme pepsin digests protein in the stomach. Further digestion and
absorption take place in the small intestine. The large intestine reabsorbs water from the undigested food
and stores waste until elimination.
Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are the primary components of food.
Some essential nutrients are
required for cellular function but cannot be produced by the animal body. These include vitamins (both fat
and water soluble) , minerals, some fatty acids, and some amino acids. Food intake in more than necessary
amounts is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells, and in adipose tissue. Excess adipose storage
can lead to obesity and serious health problems.

metabolized (broken down) and possibly synthesized into new molecules, modied if needed, transported
around the cell, and possibly distributed to the entire organism. For example, the large proteins that make
up muscles are built from smaller molecules imported from dietary amino acids. Complex carbohydrates are
broken down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and
demolish a building, energy is required for the synthesis and breakdown of molecules as well as the transport
of molecules into and out of cells. In addition, processes such as ingesting and breaking down pathogenic
bacteria and viruses, exporting wastes and toxins, and movement of the cell require energy. From where,
and in what form, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain energy, and how do they use it? This
chapter will discuss dierent forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer. This chapter
will also describe how cells use energy and replenish it, and how chemical reactions in the cell are performed
with great eciency.
6.2 Energy and Metabolism2
6.2.1 Metabolic Pathways
Cellular processes such as the building and breaking down of complex molecules occur through stepwise
chemical reactions.
Some of these chemical reactions are spontaneous and release energy, whereas others
require energy to proceed.
Just as living things must continually consume food to replenish their energy
supplies, cells must continually produce more energy to replenish that used by the many energy-requiring
chemical reactions that constantly take place. Together, all of the chemical reactions that take place inside
cells, including those that consume or generate energy, are referred to as the cell's
metabolism. Consider
the metabolism of sugar. This is a classic example of one of the many cellular processes that use and produce
energy. Living things consume sugars as a major energy source, because sugar molecules have a great deal of
energy stored within their bonds. For the most part, photosynthesizing organisms like plants produce these
sugars. During photosynthesis, plants use energy (originally from sunlight) to convert carbon dioxide gas
(CO2 ) into sugar molecules (like glucose: C6 H12 O6 ). They consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen as
a waste product. This reaction is summarized as:
6CO2 + 6H2 O − − > C6 H12 O6 + 6O2
(6.1)
Because this process involves synthesizing an energy-storing molecule, it requires energy input to proceed.
During the light reactions of photosynthesis, energy is provided by a molecule called adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), which is the primary energy currency of all cells.
Just as the dollar is used as currency to buy
goods, cells use molecules of ATP as energy currency to perform immediate work.
In contrast, energy-
storage molecules such as glucose are consumed only to be broken down to use their energy. The reaction
that harvests the energy of a sugar molecule in cells requiring oxygen to survive can be summarized by the
reverse reaction to photosynthesis. In this reaction, oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide is released as a
waste product. The reaction is summarized as:
C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 − − > 6H2 O + 6CO2
(6.1)
Both of these reactions involve many steps.
The processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two examples of metabolic pathways.
A metabolic pathway is a series of chemical reactions that takes a starting molecule and modies
it, step-by-step, through a series of metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a nal product.
In the
example of sugar metabolism, the rst metabolic pathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the
other pathway broke sugar down into smaller molecules. These two opposite processesthe rst requiring
anabolic pathways (building polymers) and
catabolic pathways (breaking down polymers into their monomers), respectively. Consequently, metabolism
energy and the second producing energyare referred to as
It is important to know that the chemical reactions of metabolic pathways do not take place on their
own. Each reaction step is facilitated, or catalyzed, by a protein called an enzyme. Enzymes are important
for catalyzing all types of biological reactionsthose that require energy as well as those that release energy.
Catabolic pathways are those that generate energy by breaking down larger molecules.
Anabolic pathways are those that require energy to synthesize larger molecules. Both types of pathways
are required for maintaining the cell's energy balance.
6.2.2 Energy
Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. The matter
relevant to a particular case of energy transfer is called a system, and everything outside of that matter is
called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the
stove, the pot, and the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water).
There are two types of systems: open and closed.
surroundings.
In an open system, energy can be exchanged with its
The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost to the air.
A closed system cannot
exchange energy with its surroundings.
Biological organisms are open systems.
Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings as
they use energy from the sun to perform photosynthesis or consume energy-storing molecules and release
energy to the environment by doing work and releasing heat. Like all things in the physical world, energy
is subject to physical laws.
The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all
systems in the universe.
In general, energy is dened as the ability to do work, or to create some kind of change. Energy exists in
dierent forms. For example, electrical energy, light energy, and heat energy are all dierent types of energy.
To appreciate the way energy ows into and out of biological systems, it is important to understand two of
the physical laws that govern energy.
6.2.3 Thermodynamics
The rst law of thermodynamics states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant and
conserved. In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy
in the universe.
Energy exists in many dierent forms.
According to the rst law of thermodynamics,
energy may be transferred from place to place or transformed into dierent forms, but it cannot be created
or destroyed. The transfers and transformations of energy take place around us all the time. Light bulbs

ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS
transform electrical energy into light and heat energy. Gas stoves transform chemical energy from natural
gas into heat energy. Plants perform one of the most biologically useful energy transformations on earth:
that of converting the energy of sunlight to chemical energy stored within organic molecules. Some examples
The challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they
can transfer or transform into usable energy to do work. Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge.
Chemical energy stored within organic molecules such as sugars and fats is transferred and transformed
through a series of cellular chemical reactions into energy within molecules of ATP. Energy in ATP molecules
is easily accessible to do work. Examples of the types of work that cells need to do include building complex
molecules, transporting materials, powering the motion of cilia or agella, and contracting muscle bers to
create movement.
and from one form to another. The food we consume provides our cells with the energy required to carry
out bodily functions, just as light energy provides plants with the means to create the chemical energy

CHAPTER 6.
ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS
A living cell's primary tasks of obtaining, transforming, and using energy to do work may seem simple.
However, the second law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear.
The
second law of thermodynamics says that energy will always be lost as heat in energy transfers or transformations. All energy transfers and transformations are never completely ecient. In every energy transfer,
some amount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy. Thermodynamically,
heat energy is dened as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not work.
For example, when a light bulb is turned on, some of the energy being converted from electrical energy into
light energy is lost as heat energy. Likewise, some energy is lost as heat energy during cellular metabolic
reactions.
6.2.4 Potential and Kinetic Energy
When an object is in motion, there is energy associated with that object. Think of a wrecking ball. Even a
slow-moving wrecking ball can do a great deal of damage to other objects. Energy associated with objects in
motion is called
of molecules in the air (which produces heat) all have kinetic energy.
Now what if that same motionless wrecking ball is lifted two stories above ground with a crane? If the
suspended wrecking ball is unmoving, is there energy associated with it? The answer is yes. The energy
that was required to lift the wrecking ball did not disappear, but is now stored in the wrecking ball by
virtue of its position and the force of gravity acting on it. This type of energy is called
potential energy
of the potential energy was exhausted when the ball rested on the ground. Wrecking balls also swing like
a pendulum; through the swing, there is a constant change of potential energy (highest at the top of the
swing) to kinetic energy (highest at the bottom of the swing). Other examples of potential energy include
the energy of water held behind a dam or a person about to skydive out of an airplane.
river, has kinetic energy.
modication of work by Frank Gualtieri)
Potential energy is not only associated with the location of matter, but also with the structure of matter.
Even a spring on the ground has potential energy if it is compressed; so does a rubber band that is pulled
taut. On a molecular level, the bonds that hold the atoms of molecules together exist in a particular structure
that has potential energy. Remember that anabolic cellular pathways require energy to synthesize complex
molecules from simpler ones and catabolic pathways release energy when complex molecules are broken down.
The fact that energy can be released by the breakdown of certain chemical bonds implies that those bonds
have potential energy. In fact, there is potential energy stored within the bonds of all the food molecules we
eat, which is eventually harnessed for use. This is because these bonds can release energy when broken. The
type of potential energy that exists within chemical bonds, and is released when those bonds are broken, is
called chemical energy. Chemical energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from food. The
release of energy occurs when the molecular bonds within food molecules are broken.
6.2.5 Free and Activation Energy
After learning that chemical reactions release energy when energy-storing bonds are broken, an important
next question is the following: How is the energy associated with these chemical reactions quantied and
expressed?
How can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another reaction?
A
measurement of free energy is used to quantify these energy transfers. Recall that according to the second
law of thermodynamics, all energy transfers involve the loss of some amount of energy in an unusable form
such as heat. Free energy specically refers to the energy associated with a chemical reaction that is available
after the losses are accounted for. In other words, free energy is usable energy, or energy that is available to
do work.
If energy is released during a chemical reaction, then the change in free energy, signied as ∆G (delta G)
will be a negative number. A negative change in free energy also means that the products of the reaction have
less free energy than the reactants, because they release some free energy during the reaction. Reactions that
have a negative change in free energy and consequently release free energy are called
exergonic reactions.
Think: ex ergonic means energy is ex iting the system. These reactions are also referred to as spontaneous
reactions, and their products have less stored energy than the reactants. An important distinction must be
drawn between the term spontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction occurring immediately. Contrary
to the everyday use of the term, a spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs. The
rusting of iron is an example of a spontaneous reaction that occurs slowly, little by little, over time.
If a chemical reaction absorbs energy rather than releases energy on balance, then the ∆G for that
reaction will be a positive value. In this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants. Thus,
the products of these reactions can be thought of as energy-storing molecules. These chemical reactions are
called
endergonic reactions and they are non-spontaneous. An endergonic reaction will not take place on
its own without the addition of free energy.
There is another important concept that must be considered regarding endergonic and exergonic reactions.
Exergonic reactions require a small amount of energy input to get going, before they can proceed with their
energy-releasing steps. These reactions have a net release of energy, but still require some energy input in
the beginning. This small amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called the
activation energy.
6.2.6 Enzymes
A substance that helps a chemical reaction to occur is called a catalyst, and the molecules that catalyze
biochemical reactions are called
enzymes.
Most enzymes are proteins and perform the critical task of
lowering the activation energies of chemical reactions inside the cell. Most of the reactions critical to a living
cell happen too slowly at normal temperatures to be of any use to the cell. Without enzymes to speed up
these reactions, life could not persist. Enzymes do this by binding to the reactant molecules and holding
them in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and -forming processes take place more easily.
It is important to remember that enzymes do not change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or
endergonic.
This is because they do not change the free energy of the reactants or products.
They only

ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS
itself is unchanged by the reaction it catalyzes. Once one reaction has been catalyzed, the enzyme is able to
participate in other reactions.
the reaction.
The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are called the enzyme's
substrates. There may be
one or more substrates, depending on the particular chemical reaction. In some reactions, a single reactant
substrate is broken down into multiple products. In others, two substrates may come together to create one
larger molecule. Two reactants might also enter a reaction and both become modied, but they leave the
reaction as two products. The location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzyme's
active site. The active site is where the action happens. Since enzymes are proteins, there is a unique
combination of amino acid side chains within the active site. Each side chain is characterized by dierent
properties.
They can be large or small, weakly acidic or basic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, positively or
negatively charged, or neutral.
The unique combination of side chains creates a very specic chemical
environment within the active site.
This specic environment is suited to bind to one specic chemical
substrate (or substrates).
Active sites are subject to inuences of the local environment. Increasing the environmental temperature
generally increases reaction rates, enzyme-catalyzed or otherwise.
However, temperatures outside of an
optimal range reduce the rate at which an enzyme catalyzes a reaction. Hot temperatures will eventually
cause enzymes to denature, an irreversible change in the three-dimensional shape and therefore the function
of the enzyme. Enzymes are also suited to function best within a certain pH and salt concentration range,
and, as with temperature, extreme pH, and salt concentrations can cause enzymes to denature.
the shape of the enzyme and the shape of the substrate change. The substrate is converted to product,
which leaves the active site.
Enzymes can also be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce enzyme activity. There are many
kinds of molecules that inhibit or promote enzyme function, and various mechanisms by which they do so.
In some cases of enzyme inhibition, an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind
to the active site and simply block the substrate from binding. When this happens, the enzyme is inhibited
through
competitive inhibition, because an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for binding
to the active site.
6.2.7 Section Summary
Cells perform the functions of life through various chemical reactions. A cell's metabolism refers to the combination of chemical reactions that take place within it. Catabolic reactions break down complex chemicals
into simpler ones and are associated with energy release. Anabolic processes build complex molecules out of
simpler ones and require energy.
In studying energy, the term system refers to the matter and environment involved in energy transfers.
Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. The physical laws that describe the transfer of energy
are the laws of thermodynamics.
The rst law states that the total amount of energy in the universe is
constant. The second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer involves some loss of energy
in an unusable form, such as heat energy. Energy comes in dierent forms: kinetic, potential, and free. The
change in free energy of a reaction can be negative (releases energy, exergonic) or positive (consumes energy,
endergonic). All reactions require an initial input of energy to proceed, called the activation energy.
Enzymes are chemical catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by lowering their activation energy.
Enzymes have an active site with a unique chemical environment that ts particular chemical reactants for
that enzyme, called substrates. Enzyme action is regulated to conserve resources and respond optimally to
the environment.
CHAPTER 6.
ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS
6.3 Glycolysis3
Even exergonic, energy-releasing reactions require a small amount of activation energy to proceed. However,
consider endergonic reactions, which require much more energy input because their products have more
free energy than their reactants. Within the cell, where does energy to power such reactions come from?
The answer lies with an energy-supplying molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or
ATP. ATP is a small,
relatively simple molecule, but within its bonds contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can
be harnessed to perform cellular work. This molecule can be thought of as the primary energy currency of
cells in the same way that money is the currency that people exchange for things they need. ATP is used to
power the majority of energy-requiring cellular reactions.
6.3.1 ATP in Living Systems
A living cell cannot store signicant amounts of free energy. Excess free energy would result in an increase of
heat in the cell, which would denature enzymes and other proteins, and thus destroy the cell. Rather, a cell
must be able to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells accomplish this using
ATP, which can be used to ll any energy need of the cell. How? It functions as a rechargeable battery.
When ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released.
This energy is used to do work by the cell, usually by the binding of the released phosphate to another
molecule, thus activating it.
For example, in the mechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies
energy to move the contractile muscle proteins.
6.3.1.1 ATP Structure and Function
At the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is composed of an adenine
sugar found in RNA and AMP is one of the nucleotides in RNA. The addition of a second phosphate group
to this core molecule results in adenosine diphosphate (ADP); the addition of a third phosphate group forms
adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
and three phosphate groups.
The addition of a phosphate group to a molecule requires a high amount of energy and results in a highenergy bond. Phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel one another when they are arranged in
series, as they are in ADP and ATP. This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable.
The release of one or two phosphate groups from ATP, a process called hydrolysis, releases energy. Hydrolysis
occurs when water is added to break the chemical bond and is the opposite of dehydration synthesis reactions
discussed previously.
6.3.2 Glycolysis
You have read that nearly all of the energy used by living things comes to them in the bonds of the sugar,
glucose.
Glycolysis is the rst step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cell metabolism. Many
living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of
eukaryotic cells.
Glycolysis begins with the six-carbon, ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with
two molecules of a three-carbon sugar called pyruvate. Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases. In the rst
part of the glycolysis pathway, energy is used to make adjustments so that the six-carbon sugar molecule
can be split evenly into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.
In the second part of glycolysis, ATP and

ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS
that is able to accept electrons and hydrogen from the glucose. NADH carries the electrons to a later stage
in metabolism to be used to provide energy (indirectly) to catalyze the endergonic reaction of adding a
phosphate group to ADP to make ATP.
If the cell cannot catabolize the pyruvate molecules further, it will harvest only two ATP molecules from
one molecule of glucose.
For example, mature mammalian red blood cells are only capable of glycolysis,
which is their sole source of ATP. If glycolysis is interrupted, these cells would eventually die.
In glycolysis, a glucose molecule is converted into two pyruvate molecules.
Notice that
each of the two molecules has three carbon atoms, representing the six carbons that were present in
the glucose that started the process. This means that no carbon dioxide is released in glycolysis, as the
carbon to make it comes from the glucose molecule.
6.3.3 Section Summary
ATP functions as the energy currency for cells. It allows cells to store energy briey and transport it within
itself to support endergonic chemical reactions. The structure of ATP is that of an RNA nucleotide with
three phosphate groups attached. As ATP is used for energy, a phosphate group is detached, and ADP is

ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS
produced. Energy derived from glucose catabolism is used to recharge ADP into ATP.
Glycolysis is the rst pathway used in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy. Because it is used by
nearly all organisms on earth, it must have evolved early in the history of life. Glycolysis consists of two
parts: The rst part prepares the six-carbon ring of glucose for separation into two three-carbon sugars.
Energy from ATP is invested into the molecule during this step to energize the separation. The second half
+
of glycolysis extracts ATP and high-energy electrons from hydrogen atoms and attaches them to NAD .
Two ATP molecules are invested in the rst half and four ATP molecules are formed during the second half.
This produces a net gain of two ATP molecules per molecule of glucose for the cell.

6.4 The Transition Reaction, Citric Acid/Kreb's Cycle and Electron
Transport Chain/Oxidative Phosphorylation4
6.4.1 The Transition Reaction and Citric Acid/Kreb's Cycle
In eukaryotic cells, the pyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolysis are transported into mitochondria, which are sites of cellular respiration. If oxygen is available, aerobic respiration will go forward.
In mitochondria, pyruvate will be transformed into a two-carbon acetyl group (by removing a molecule of
carbon dioxide) that will be picked up by a carrier compound called coenzyme A (CoA), which is made from
vitamin B. The resulting compound is called
the transition reaction, as it happens during pyruvate transport into the mitochondria. The major function
of acetyl CoA is to deliver the acetyl group (2 carbon fragment) derived from pyruvate to the next pathway
in glucose catabolism, which is the citric acid/Kreb's cycle. Note that during the transition reaction, each
pyruvate/pyruvic acid molecule loses one carbon as carbon dioxide and one molecule of NADH is produced.
Therefore, a total of two molecules of carbon dioxide and two molecules of NADH are produced per glucose
that started glycolysis.
citric acid/Kreb's cycle.
Like the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the
citric acid cycle (also called the Kreb's cycle) in
eukaryotic cells takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria. Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is a
closed loop: The last part of the pathway regenerates the compound used in the rst step. The eight steps
of the cycle are a series of chemical reactions that produces two carbon dioxide molecules, one ATP molecule
(or an equivalent), and reduced forms (NADH and FADH2 ) of NAD
+ and FAD+ , important coenzymes in
the cell. Part of this is considered an aerobic pathway (oxygen-requiring) because the NADH and FADH2
produced must transfer their electrons to the next pathway in the system, which will use oxygen. If oxygen
is not present, this transfer does not occur. Note that per glucose that started glycolysis, processing of the
two pyruvate/pyruvic acid molecules in the citric acid cycle will result in the production of a total of six
NADH, two FADH2 , and two ATP. Also note that at this point, a total of six molecules of carbon dioxide
have been released, which accounts for the six carbons in the starting glucose molecule. The high-energy
NADH and FADH2 will be used in the last stage of aerobic respiration to produce additional ATP molecules.
6.4.2 Electron Transport Chain/Oxidative Phosphorylation
You have just read about two pathways in glucose catabolismglycolysis and the citric acid cyclethat
generate ATP. Most of the ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose, however, is not generated
directly from these pathways. Rather, it derives from a process that begins with passing electrons through
a series of chemical reactions to a nal electron acceptor, oxygen. These reactions take place in specialized
protein complexes located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria.
The energy of the electrons is
harvested and used to generate a electrochemical gradient of hydrogen ions across the inner mitochondrial
membrane. The potential energy of this gradient is used to generate ATP by providing the energy to add
phosphate groups to ADP molecules. The entirety of this process is called
oxidative phosphorylation, as
oxygen is required as the terminal electron acceptor and phosphate groups are added to ADP molecules.

In animals, oxygen enters the body through the respiratory system. Electron transport is a series of chemical
reactions that resembles a bucket brigade in that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the next,
to the endpoint of the chain where oxygen is the nal electron acceptor and water is produced. There are

Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are passed to protein complexes in the electron transport chain. As they
are passed from one complex to another (there are a total of four), the electrons lose energy, and some of
that energy is used to pump hydrogen ions from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. In
the fourth protein complex, the electrons are accepted by oxygen, the terminal acceptor. The oxygen with
its extra electrons then combines with two hydrogen ions, further enhancing the electrochemical gradient,
to form water. If there were no oxygen present in the mitochondrion, the electrons could not be removed
from the system, and the entire electron transport chain would back up and stop. The mitochondria would
be unable to generate new ATP in this way, and the cell would ultimately die from lack of energy. This is
the reason we must breathe to draw in new oxygen.
In the electron transport chain, the free energy from the series of reactions just described is used to pump

hydrogen ions (via active transport) across the membrane. The uneven distribution of H

from hydrogen atoms. These atoms were originally part of a glucose molecule. At the end of the electron
transport system, the electrons are used to reduce an oxygen molecule to oxygen ions. The extra electrons
on the oxygen ions attract hydrogen ions (protons) from the surrounding medium, and water is formed.
6.4.3 ATP Yield
The number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies. In general, processing of
each NADH yields approximately 3 ATP and each FADH2 yields approximately 2 ATP. Overall, a total
of 10 NADH and 2 FADH2 were produced in glycolysis, transition reaction, and the citric acid cycle per
glucose molecule. This results in the production of approximately 34 ATP. Remember, that two additional
ATP were produced directly in both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, resulting in a total yield of 38 ATP
per glucose. This represents an eciency of approximately 35%, with the remaining energy potential lost as
heat or other products.

6.4.4 Section Summary
The citric acid cycle is a series of chemical reactions that removes high-energy electrons and uses them in
the electron transport chain to generate ATP. One molecule of ATP (or an equivalent) is produced per each
turn of the cycle.
The electron transport chain is the portion of aerobic respiration that uses free oxygen as the nal electron
acceptor for electrons removed from the intermediate compounds in glucose catabolism. The electrons are

transport hydrogen ions across the membrane. This contributes to the gradient used in chemiosmosis. As
the electrons are passed from NADH or FADH2 down the electron transport chain, they lose energy. The
products of the electron transport chain are water and ATP. A number of intermediate compounds can be
diverted into the anabolism of other biochemical molecules, such as nucleic acids, non-essential amino acids,
sugars, and lipids. These same molecules, except nucleic acids, can serve as energy sources for the glucose
pathway.

6.5 Fermentation5
In aerobic respiration, the nal electron acceptor is an oxygen molecule, O2 . If aerobic respiration occurs,
then ATP will be produced using the energy of the high-energy electrons carried by NADH or FADH2 to
the electron transport chain. If aerobic respiration does not occur, NADH must be reoxidized to NAD

reuse as an electron carrier for glycolysis to continue. How is this done? Humans use an organic molecule

7.1 Introduction to the Cardiovascular System - Blood1
Blood Cells
One of each type is shown here (from left to right) isolated from a scanning electron micrograph.
note:
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Identify the primary functions of blood, its uid and cellular components, and its physical
characteristics
• Identify the most important proteins and other solutes present in blood plasma
• Describe the formation of the formed element components of blood
• Discuss the structure and function of red blood cells and hemoglobin
• Explain the signicance of AB and Rh blood groups in blood transfusions
• Discuss a variety of blood disorders
The human body needs blood to deliver nutrients to and remove wastes from our trillions of cells. The heart
pumps blood throughout the body in a network of blood vessels. Together, these three componentsblood,
heart, and vesselsmakes up the cardiovascular system. This chapter focuses on the medium of transport:
blood.
7.2 An Overview of Blood2
Blood is a connective tissue. Like all connective tissues, it is made up of cellular elements and an extracellular matrix. The cellular elementsreferred to as the formed elementsinclude red blood cells
(RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and cell fragments called platelets. The extracellular matrix,
called plasma, makes blood unique among connective tissues because it is uid. This uid, which is mostly
water, perpetually suspends the formed elements and enables them to circulate throughout the body within
the cardiovascular system.
7.2.1 Functions of Blood
The primary function of blood is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to and remove wastes from body cells, but
that is only the beginning of the story. The specic functions of blood also include defense, distribution of
heat, and maintenance of homeostasis.
7.2.1.1 Transportation
Nutrients from the foods you eat are absorbed in the digestive tract. Most of these travel in the bloodstream
directly to the liver, where they are processed and released back into the bloodstream for delivery to body
cells. Oxygen from the air you breathe diuses into the blood, which moves from the lungs to the heart,
which then pumps it out to the rest of the body. Moreover, endocrine glands scattered throughout the body
release their products, called hormones, into the bloodstream, which carries them to distant target cells.
Blood also picks up cellular wastes and byproducts, and transports them to various organs for removal. For
instance, blood moves carbon dioxide to the lungs for exhalation from the body, and various waste products
are transported to the kidneys and liver for excretion from the body in the form of urine or bile.
7.2.1.2 Defense
Many types of WBCs protect the body from external threats, such as disease-causing bacteria that have
entered the bloodstream in a wound. Other WBCs seek out and destroy internal threats, such as cells with
mutated DNA that could multiply to become cancerous, or body cells infected with viruses.
When damage to the vessels results in bleeding, blood platelets and certain proteins dissolved in the
plasma, the uid portion of the blood, interact to block the ruptured areas of the blood vessels involved.
This protects the body from further blood loss.
CHAPTER 7.
BLOOD
7.2.1.3 Maintenance of Homeostasis
Recall that body temperature is regulated via a classic negative-feedback loop. If you were exercising on
a warm day, your rising core body temperature would trigger several homeostatic mechanisms, including
increased transport of blood from your core to your body periphery, which is typically cooler.
As blood
passes through the vessels of the skin, heat would be dissipated to the environment, and the blood returning
to your body core would be cooler.
In contrast, on a cold day, blood is diverted away from the skin to
maintain a warmer body core. In extreme cases, this may result in frostbite.
Blood also helps to maintain the chemical balance of the body. Proteins and other compounds in blood
act as buers, which thereby help to regulate the pH of body tissues. Blood also helps to regulate the water
content of body cells.
7.2.2 Composition of Blood
You have probably had blood drawn from a supercial vein in your arm, which was then sent to a lab for
analysis.
Some of the most common blood testsfor instance, those measuring lipid or glucose levels in
plasmadetermine which substances are present within blood and in what quantities. Other blood tests
check for the composition of the blood itself, including the quantities and types of formed elements.
One such test, called a
hematocrit, measures the percentage of RBCs, clinically known as erythrocytes,
in a blood sample. It is performed by spinning the blood sample in a specialized centrifuge, a process that
causes the heavier elements suspended within the blood sample to separate from the lightweight, liquid
these settle at the very bottom of the hematocrit tube. Located above the erythrocytes is a pale, thin layer
composed of the remaining formed elements of blood. These are the WBCs, clinically known as leukocytes,
and the platelets, cell fragments also called thrombocytes. This layer is referred to as the
buy coat because
of its color; it normally constitutes less than 1 percent of a blood sample. Above the buy coat is the blood
plasma, normally a pale, straw-colored uid, which constitutes the remainder of the sample.
In normal blood, about 45 percent of a sample is erythrocytes. The hematocrit of any one sample can
vary signicantly, however, about 3650 percent, according to gender and other factors. Normal hematocrit
values for females range from 37 to 47, with a mean value of 41; for males, hematocrit ranges from 42 to
52, with a mean of 47.
The percentage of other formed elements, the WBCs and platelets, is extremely
small so it is not normally considered with the hematocrit. So the mean plasma percentage is the percent
of blood that is not erythrocytes: for females, it is approximately 59 (or 100 minus 41), and for males, it is
approximately 53 (or 100 minus 47).
Composition of Blood
The cellular elements of blood include a vast number of erythrocytes and comparatively
fewer leukocytes and platelets.
Plasma is the uid in which the formed elements are suspended.
A
sample of blood spun in a centrifuge reveals that plasma is the lightest component. It oats at the top
of the tube separated from the heaviest elements, the erythrocytes, by a buy coat of leukocytes and
platelets. Hematocrit is the percentage of the total sample that is comprised of erythrocytes. Depressed
and elevated hematocrit levels are shown for comparison.
7.2.3 Characteristics of Blood
When you think about blood, the rst characteristic that probably comes to mind is its color. Blood that
has just taken up oxygen in the lungs is bright red, and blood that has released oxygen in the tissues is a
more dusky (i.e bluish) red. This is because hemoglobin is a pigment that changes color, depending upon
the degree of oxygen saturation.
The normal temperature of blood is slightly higher than normal body temperatureabout 38
◦
F), compared to 37
of 0.5
◦
◦
C (or 98.6
◦
◦
C (or 100.4
F) for an internal body temperature reading, although daily variations
C are normal. Although the surface of blood vessels is relatively smooth, as blood ows through
them, it experiences some friction and resistance, especially as vessels age and lose their elasticity, thereby
producing heat. This accounts for its slightly higher temperature.
The pH of blood averages about 7.4; however, it can range from 7.35 to 7.45 in a healthy person. Blood
is therefore somewhat more basic (alkaline) on a chemical scale than pure water, which has a pH of 7.0.
Blood contains numerous buers that actually help to regulate pH.
Blood constitutes approximately 8 percent of adult body weight. Adult males typically average about 5
to 6 liters of blood. Females average 45 liters.
CHAPTER 7.
BLOOD
7.2.4 Blood Plasma
Like other uids in the body, plasma is composed primarily of water: In fact, it is about 92 percent water.
Dissolved or suspended within this water is a mixture of substances, most of which are proteins. There are
literally hundreds of substances dissolved or suspended in the plasma, although many of them are found only
in very small quantities.
7.2.4.1 Plasma Proteins
About 7 percent of the volume of plasmanearly all that is not wateris made of proteins. These include
several plasma proteins (proteins that are unique to the plasma), plus a much smaller number of regulatory
proteins, including enzymes and some hormones. The major components of plasma are summarized in .
The three major groups of plasma proteins are as follows:
• Albumin is the most abundant of the plasma proteins. Manufactured by the liver, albumin molecules
serve as binding proteinstransport vehicles for fatty acids and steroid hormones. Recall that lipids
are hydrophobic; however, their binding to albumin enables their transport in the watery plasma.
Albumin is also the most signicant contributor to the osmotic pressure of blood; that is, its presence
holds water inside the blood vessels and draws water from the tissues, across blood vessel walls, and
into the bloodstream. This in turn helps to maintain both blood volume and blood pressure. Albumin
normally accounts for approximately 54 percent of the total plasma protein content, in clinical levels
of 3.55.0 g/dL blood.
•
The second most common plasma proteins are the
globulins. A heterogeneous group, there are three
main subgroups known as alpha, beta, and gamma globulins. The alpha and beta globulins transport
iron, lipids, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K to the cells; like albumin, they also contribute
to osmotic pressure. The gamma globulins are proteins involved in immunity and are better known
as an
antibodies or immunoglobulins. Although other plasma proteins are produced by the liver,
immunoglobulins are produced by specialized leukocytes known as plasma cells. Globulins make up
approximately 38 percent of the total plasma protein volume, in clinical levels of 1.01.5 g/dL blood.
•
The least abundant plasma protein is
brinogen. Like albumin and the alpha and beta globulins,
brinogen is produced by the liver. It is essential for blood clotting, a process described later in this
chapter. Fibrinogen accounts for about 7 percent of the total plasma protein volume, in clinical levels
of 0.20.45 g/dL blood.
7.2.4.2 Other Plasma Solutes
In addition to proteins, plasma contains a wide variety of other substances. These include various electrolytes,
such as sodium, potassium, and calcium ions; dissolved gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen;
various organic nutrients, such as vitamins, lipids, glucose, and amino acids; and metabolic wastes. All of
these nonprotein solutes combined contribute approximately 1 percent to the total volume of plasma.
:
Phlebotomy and Medical Lab Technology
Phlebotomists are professionals trained to draw blood (phleb- = a blood vessel; -tomy = to
cut). When more than a few drops of blood are required, phlebotomists perform a venipuncture,
typically of a surface vein in the arm. They perform a capillary stick on a nger, an earlobe, or
the heel of an infant when only a small quantity of blood is required. An arterial stick is collected
from an artery and used to analyze blood gases. After collection, the blood may be analyzed by
medical laboratories or perhaps used for transfusions, donations, or research. While many allied
health professionals practice phlebotomy, the American Society of Phlebotomy Technicians issues
certicates to individuals passing a national examination, and some large labs and hospitals hire
individuals expressly for their skill in phlebotomy.
Medical or clinical laboratories employ a variety of individuals in technical positions:
• Medical technologists (MT), also known as clinical laboratory technologists (CLT), typically
hold a bachelor's degree and certication from an accredited training program. They perform
a wide variety of tests on various body uids, including blood. The information they provide
is essential to the primary care providers in determining a diagnosis and in monitoring the
course of a disease and response to treatment.
• Medical laboratory technicians (MLT) typically have an associate's degree but may perform
duties similar to those of an MT.
• Medical laboratory assistants (MLA) spend the majority of their time processing samples and
carrying out routine assignments within the lab. Clinical training is required, but a degree
may not be essential to obtaining a position.
7.2.5 Chapter Review
Blood is a uid connective tissue critical to the transportation of nutrients, gases, and wastes throughout
the body; to defend the body against infection and other threats; and to the homeostatic regulation of pH,
temperature, and other internal conditions. Blood is composed of formed elementserythrocytes, leukocytes,
and cell fragments called plateletsand a uid extracellular matrix called plasma. More than 90 percent of
plasma is water. The remainder is mostly plasma proteinsmainly albumin, globulins, and brinogenand
other dissolved solutes such as glucose, lipids, electrolytes, and dissolved gases. Blood is also slightly alkaline,
and its temperature is slightly higher than normal body temperature.
7.3 Erythrocytes3
The
erythrocyte, commonly known as a red blood cell (or RBC), is by far the most common formed element:
A single drop of blood contains millions of erythrocytes and just thousands of leukocytes. Specically, males
have about 5.4 million erythrocytes per microliter (µL) of blood, and females have approximately 4.8 million
per µL. In fact, erythrocytes are estimated to make up about 25 percent of the total cells in the body. As
you can imagine, they are quite small cells, with a mean diameter of only about 78 micrometers (µm). The
primary functions of erythrocytes are to pick up inhaled oxygen from the lungs and transport it to the body's
tissues, and to pick up some (about 24 percent) carbon dioxide waste at the tissues and transport it to the
lungs for exhalation. Erythrocytes remain within the vascular network. Although leukocytes typically leave
the blood vessels to perform their defensive functions, movement of erythrocytes from the blood vessels is
abnormal.
7.3.1 Shape and Structure of Erythrocytes
As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles.
Lacking mitochondria, for example, they rely on fermentation. This means that they do not utilize any of the
oxygen they are transporting, so they can deliver it all to the tissues. They also lack endoplasmic reticula and
do not synthesize proteins, so they are unable to repair themselves. This is why the lifespan of a red blood
cell is approximately 115 days. However, during this time, the red blood cell has traveled approximately 300
CHAPTER 7.
BLOOD
Erythrocytes are biconcave disks; that is, they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center
the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that, as you will see shortly, transport gases. The biconcave shape
also provides a greater surface area across which gas exchange can occur, relative to its volume; a sphere of
a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio. In the capillaries, the oxygen carried by
the erythrocytes can diuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells, whereas
some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product diuses into the capillaries to be picked
up by the erythrocytes. Capillary beds are extremely narrow, slowing the passage of the erythrocytes and
providing an extended opportunity for gas exchange to occur.
However, the space within capillaries can
be so minute that, despite their own small size, erythrocytes may have to fold in on themselves if they are
to make their way through. Fortunately, their structural proteins are exible, allowing them to bend over
themselves to a surprising degree, then spring back again when they enter a wider vessel.
Shape of Red Blood Cells
of surface area to volume, facilitating gas exchange. It also enables them to fold up as they move through
narrow blood vessels.
7.3.2 Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin is a large molecule made up of proteins and iron. It consists of four folded chains of a protein
molecules is bound to a red pigment molecule called heme, which contains an ion of iron (Fe
(Hemoglobin )b).
Hemoglobin
(a) A molecule of hemoglobin contains four globin proteins, each of which is bound to
one molecule of the iron-containing pigment heme.
(b) A single erythrocyte can contain 300 million
hemoglobin molecules, and thus more than 1 billion oxygen molecules.
Each iron ion in the heme can bind to one oxygen molecule; therefore, each hemoglobin molecule can
transport four oxygen molecules.
An individual erythrocyte may contain about 300 million hemoglobin
b
(Hemoglobin ) ).
In the lungs, hemoglobin picks up oxygen, which binds to the iron ions, forming
oxyhemoglobin. The
bright red, oxygenated hemoglobin travels to the body tissues, where it releases some of the oxygen molecules,
becoming darker red
deoxyhemoglobin. Oxygen release depends on the need for oxygen in the surrounding
tissues, so hemoglobin rarely if ever leaves all of its oxygen behind. In the capillaries, carbon dioxide enters
the bloodstream.
About 76 percent dissolves in the plasma, some of it remaining as dissolved CO2 , and
the remainder forming bicarbonate ion. About 2324 percent of it binds to the amino acids in hemoglobin,
forming a molecule known as
carbaminohemoglobin. From the capillaries, the hemoglobin carries carbon
dioxide back to the lungs, where it releases it for exchange of oxygen.
In patients with insucient hemoglobin, the tissues may not receive sucient oxygen, resulting in another
form of anemia.
In determining oxygenation of tissues, the value of greatest interest in healthcare is the
percent saturation; that is, the percentage of hemoglobin sites occupied by oxygen in a patient's blood.
Clinically this value is commonly referred to simply as percent sat.
CHAPTER 7.
BLOOD
Percent saturation is normally monitored using a device known as a pulse oximeter, which is applied
to a thin part of the body, typically the tip of the patient's nger.
The device works by sending two
dierent wavelengths of light (one red, the other infrared) through the nger and measuring the light with a
photodetector as it exits. Hemoglobin absorbs light dierentially depending upon its saturation with oxygen.
The machine calibrates the amount of light received by the photodetector against the amount absorbed by
the partially oxygenated hemoglobin and presents the data as percent saturation. Normal pulse oximeter
readings range from 95100 percent. Lower percentages reect
hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen. The term
hypoxia is more generic and simply refers to low oxygen levels. Oxygen levels are also directly monitored
from free oxygen in the plasma typically following an arterial stick. When this method is applied, the amount
of oxygen present is expressed in terms of partial pressure of oxygen or simply pO2 and is typically recorded
in units of millimeters of mercury, mm Hg.
7.3.3 Lifecycle of Erythrocytes
Production of erythrocytes in the marrow occurs at the staggering rate of more than 2 million cells per
second.
For this production to occur, a number of raw materials must be present in adequate amounts.
These include the same nutrients that are essential to the production and maintenance of any cell, such as
glucose, lipids, and amino acids. However, erythrocyte production also requires several trace elements: iron,
copper, zinc, and several types of B vitamins.
Erythrocytes live up to 120 days in the circulation, after which the worn-out cells are removed by a type
of phagocytic cell called a
macrophage, located primarily within the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. The
components of the degraded erythrocytes' hemoglobin are further processed, with some being retained by
the body and others being released in the urine and feces.
The breakdown pigments formed from the destruction of hemoglobin can be seen in a variety of situations.
At the site of an injury, biliverdin from damaged RBCs produces some of the dramatic colors associated
with bruising. With a failing liver, bilirubin cannot be removed eectively from circulation and causes the
body to assume a yellowish tinge associated with jaundice. Stercobilins within the feces produce the typical
brown color associated with this waste. And the yellow of urine is associated with the urobilins.
7.3.4 Disorders of Erythrocytes
The size, shape, and number of erythrocytes, and the number of hemoglobin molecules can have a major
impact on a person's health. When the number of RBCs or hemoglobin is decient, the general condition
is called
anemia. There are more than 400 types of anemia and more than 3.5 million Americans suer
from this condition. Anemia can be broken down into three major groups: those caused by blood loss, those
caused by faulty or decreased RBC production, and those caused by excessive destruction of RBCs. The
eects of the various anemias are widespread, because reduced numbers of RBCs or hemoglobin will result
in lower levels of oxygen being delivered to body tissues.
Since oxygen is required for tissue functioning,
anemia produces fatigue, lethargy, and an increased risk for infection. An oxygen decit in the brain impairs
the ability to think clearly, and may prompt headaches and irritability. Lack of oxygen leaves the patient
short of breath, even as the heart and lungs work harder in response to the decit.
Anemias caused by faulty or decreased RBC production include sickle cell anemia, iron deciency anemia,
vitamin deciency anemia, and diseases of the bone marrow and stem cells.
•
A characteristic change in the shape of erythrocytes is seen in
sickle cell disease (also referred to as
sickle cell anemia). A genetic disorder, it is caused by production of an abnormal type of hemoglobin,
called hemoglobin S, which delivers less oxygen to tissues and causes erythrocytes to assume a sickle (or
shaped cells can then become lodged in narrow capillaries because they are unable to fold in on
themselves to squeeze through, blocking blood ow to tissues and causing a variety of serious problems
from painful joints to delayed growth and even blindness and cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). Sickle
cell anemia is a genetic condition particularly found in individuals of African descent.
Sickle Cells
produce an abnormal type of hemoglobin, which causes the cell to take on a sickle or crescent shape.
•
Iron deciency anemia is the most common type and results when the amount of available iron is
insucient to allow production of sucient heme.
This condition can occur in individuals with a
deciency of iron in the diet and is especially common in teens and children as well as in vegans and
vegetarians. Additionally, iron deciency anemia may be caused by either an inability to absorb and
transport iron or slow, chronic bleeding.
•
Vitamin-decient anemias generally involve insucient vitamin B12 and folate.
◦ Pernicious anemia is caused by poor absorption of vitamin B12 and is often seen in patients with
Crohn's disease (a severe intestinal disorder often treated by surgery), surgical removal of the
intestines or stomach (common in some weight loss surgeries), intestinal parasites, and AIDS.
◦ Pregnancies, some medications, excessive alcohol consumption, and some diseases such as celiac
disease are also associated with vitamin deciencies. It is essential to provide sucient folic acid

BLOOD
during the early stages of pregnancy to reduce the risk of neurological defects, including spina
bida, a failure of the neural tube to close.
•
Assorted disease processes can also interfere with the production and formation of RBCs and
hemoglobin.
If blood stem cells are defective or replaced by cancer cells, there will be insucient
quantities of RBCs produced.
◦ Aplastic anemia is the condition in which there are decient numbers of RBC stem cells. Aplastic
anemia is often inherited, or it may be triggered by radiation, medication, chemotherapy, or
infection.
◦ Thalassemia is an inherited condition typically occurring in individuals from the Middle East,
the Mediterranean, African, and Southeast Asia, in which maturation of the RBCs does not
proceed normally. The most severe form is called Cooley's anemia.
◦ Lead exposure from industrial sources or even dust from paint chips of iron-containing paints or
pottery that has not been properly glazed may also lead to destruction of the red marrow.
In contrast to anemia, an elevated RBC count is called
polycythemia and is detected in a patient's elevated
hematocrit. It can occur transiently in a person who is dehydrated; when water intake is inadequate or water
losses are excessive, the plasma volume falls. As a result, the hematocrit rises. For reasons mentioned earlier,
a mild form of polycythemia is chronic but normal in people living at high altitudes. Some elite athletes
train at high elevations specically to induce this phenomenon. Finally, a type of bone marrow disease called
polycythemia vera (from the Greek vera = true) causes an excessive production of immature erythrocytes.
Polycythemia vera can dangerously elevate the viscosity of blood, raising blood pressure and making it more
dicult for the heart to pump blood throughout the body. It is a relatively rare disease that occurs more
often in men than women, and is more likely to be present in elderly patients those over 60 years of age.
7.3.5 Chapter Review
The most abundant formed elements in blood, erythrocytes are red, biconcave disks packed with an oxygencarrying compound called hemoglobin.
The hemoglobin molecule contains four globin proteins bound to
a pigment molecule called heme, which contains an ion of iron. In the bloodstream, iron picks up oxygen
in the lungs and drops it o in the tissues; the amino acids in hemoglobin then transport carbon dioxide
from the tissues back to the lungs.
Erythrocytes live approximately 115 days on average, and thus must
be continually replaced. Worn-out erythrocytes are phagocytized by macrophages and their hemoglobin is
broken down. The breakdown products are recycled or removed as wastes. Anemia is a deciency of RBCs
or hemoglobin, whereas polycythemia is an excess of RBCs.
7.4 Blood Typing and Transfusions4
Blood transfusions in humans were risky procedures until the discovery of the major human blood groups
by Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian biologist and physician, in 1900.
Until that point, physicians did not
understand that death sometimes followed blood transfusions, when the type of donor blood infused into
the patient was incompatible with the patient's own blood. Blood groups are determined by the presence or
absence of specic marker molecules, called antigens, on the plasma membranes of erythrocytes. With their
discovery, it became possible for the rst time to match patient-donor blood types and prevent transfusion
reactions and deaths.
7.4.1 Antigens, Antibodies, and Transfusion Reactions
Antigens are substances that the body does not recognize as belonging to the self  and that therefore trigger
a defensive response from the leukocytes (WBC) of the immune system. Here, we will focus on the role of
immunity, antigens, and antibodies in blood transfusion reactions.
Antigens are generally large proteins, but may include other classes of organic molecules, including
carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.
Following an infusion of incompatible blood, erythrocytes with
foreign antigens appear in the bloodstream and trigger an immune response. Proteins called antibodies (immunoglobulins), which are produced by certain B lymphocytes called plasma cells, attach to the antigens on
the plasma membranes of the infused erythrocytes and cause them to stick to one another (i.e. agglutinate).
The clumps of erythrocytes block small blood vessels throughout the body, depriving tissues of oxygen and
nutrients.
As the erythrocyte clumps are degraded, in a process called
hemolysis, their hemoglobin is
released into the bloodstream. This hemoglobin travels to the kidneys, which are responsible for ltration
of the blood. However, the load of hemoglobin released can easily overwhelm the kidney's capacity to clear
it, and the patient can quickly develop kidney failure.
CHAPTER 7.
BLOOD
More than 50 antigens have been identied on erythrocyte membranes, but the most signicant in terms
of their potential harm to patients are classied in two groups: the ABO blood group and the Rh blood
group.
7.4.2 The ABO Blood Group
Although the
ABO blood group name consists of three letters, ABO blood typing designates the presence
or absence of just two antigens, A and B. Both are glycoproteins. People whose erythrocytes have A antigens
on their erythrocyte membrane surfaces are designated blood type A, and those whose erythrocytes have B
antigens are blood type B. People can also have both A and B antigens on their erythrocytes, in which case
they are blood type AB. People with neither A nor B antigens are designated blood type O. ABO blood
types are genetically determined.
Normally the body must be exposed to a foreign antigen before an antibody can be produced.
This
is not the case for the ABO blood group. Individuals with type A bloodwithout any prior exposure to
incompatible bloodhave preformed antibodies to the B antigen circulating in their blood plasma. These
antibodies, referred to as anti-B antibodies, will cause agglutination and hemolysis if they ever encounter
erythrocytes with B antigens. Similarly, an individual with type B blood has pre-formed anti-A antibodies.
Individuals with type AB blood, which has both antigens, do not have preformed antibodies to either of
these. People with type O blood lack antigens A and B on their erythrocytes, but both anti-A and anti-B
antibodies circulate in their blood plasma.
7.4.3 Rh Blood Groups
The
Rh blood group is classied according to the presence or absence of a second erythrocyte antigen
identied as Rh. (It was rst discovered in a type of primate known as a rhesus macaque, which is often
used in research, because its blood is similar to that of humans.) Although dozens of Rh antigens have been
identied, only one, designated D, is clinically important. Those who have the Rh D antigen present on their
+
erythrocytesabout 85 percent of Americansare described as Rh positive (Rh ) and those who lack it are
−
Rh negative (Rh ). Note that the Rh group is distinct from the ABO group, so any individual, no matter
their ABO blood type, may have or lack this Rh antigen. When identifying a patient's blood type, the Rh
+
group is designated by adding the word positive or negative to the ABO type. For example, A positive (A )
−
means ABO group A blood with the Rh antigen present, and AB negative (AB ) means ABO group AB
blood without the Rh antigen.

mother's immune system begins to generate anti-Rh antibodies. If the mother should then conceive another
Rh
+ baby, the Rh antibodies she has produced can cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream and destroy
the fetal RBCs. This condition, known as
hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) or erythroblastosis
fetalis, may cause anemia in mild cases, but the agglutination and hemolysis can be so severe that without
treatment the fetus may die in the womb or shortly after birth.

Since the introduction of RhoGAM in 1968, the incidence has dropped to about 0.1 percent in the United
States.
7.4.4 Determining ABO Blood Types
Clinicians are able to determine a patient's blood type quickly and easily using commercially prepared
antibodies.
An unknown blood sample is allocated into separate wells.
Into one well a small amount of
anti-A antibody is added, and to another a small amount of anti-B antibody. If the antigen is present, the
The
blood should also be tested for Rh antibodies.
Cross Matching Blood Types
This sample of a commercially produced bedside card enables quick typing of both a
recipient's and donor's blood before transfusion. The card contains three reaction sites or wells. One is
coated with an anti-A antibody, one with an anti-B antibody, and one with an anti-D antibody (tests
for the presence of Rh factor D). Mixing a drop of blood and saline into each well enables the blood to
interact with a preparation of type-specic antibodies, also called anti-seras. Agglutination of RBCs in
a given site indicates a positive identication of the blood antigens, in this case A and Rh antigens for
+
blood type A . For the purpose of transfusion, the donor's and recipient's blood types must match.
7.4.5 ABO Transfusion Protocols
To avoid transfusion reactions, it is best to transfuse only matching blood types; that is, a type B
+ recipient
+
should ideally receive blood only from a type B donor and so on. That said, in emergency situations, when
acute hemorrhage threatens the patient's life, there may not be time for cross matching to identify blood
type. In these cases, blood from a
universal donoran individual with type O− bloodmay be transfused.
Recall that type O erythrocytes do not display A or B antigens.
Thus, anti-A or anti-B antibodies that
might be circulating in the patient's blood plasma will not encounter any erythrocyte surface antigens on
the donated blood and therefore will not be provoked into a response. One problem with this designation
−
of universal donor is if the O
individual had prior exposure to Rh antigen, Rh antibodies may be present
in the donated blood. Also, introducing type O blood into an individual with type A, B, or AB blood will

BLOOD
nevertheless introduce antibodies against both A and B antigens, as these are always circulating in the type
O blood plasma. This may cause problems for the recipient, but because the volume of blood transfused
is much lower than the volume of the patient's own blood, the adverse eects of the relatively few infused
plasma antibodies are typically limited.
Rh factor also plays a role.
−
If Rh
individuals receiving blood
have had prior exposure to Rh antigen, antibodies for this antigen may be present in the blood and trigger
agglutination to some degree.

transfusing, in a true life-threatening emergency situation, this is not always possible, and these procedures
may be implemented.

Antigens are nonself molecules, usually large proteins, which provoke an immune response. In transfusion
reactions, antibodies attach to antigens on the surfaces of erythrocytes and cause agglutination and hemolysis.
ABO blood group antigens are designated A and B. People with type A blood have A antigens on their
erythrocytes, whereas those with type B blood have B antigens. Those with AB blood have both A and B
antigens, and those with type O blood have neither A nor B antigens. The blood plasma contains preformed
antibodies against the antigens not present on a person's erythrocytes.

8.1 Introduction to the Cardiovascular System - Heart1
Human Heart
note:
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Identify and describe the interior and exterior parts of the human heart
• Describe the path of blood through the cardiac circuits
• Describe the size, shape, and location of the heart
• Compare cardiac muscle to skeletal and smooth muscle
• Explain the cardiac conduction system
• Describe the process and purpose of an electrocardiogram
• Explain the cardiac cycle
• Describe the eects of exercise on heart rate
• Identify other factors aecting heart rate
In this chapter, you will explore the remarkable pump that propels the blood into the vessels. There is no
single better word to describe the function of the heart other than pump, since its contraction develops the
pressure that ejects blood into the major vessels: the aorta and pulmonary trunk. From these vessels, the
blood is distributed to the remainder of the body. Although the connotation of the term pump suggests a
mechanical device made of steel and plastic, the anatomical structure is a living, sophisticated muscle. As
you read this chapter, try to keep these twin concepts in mind: pump and muscle.
Although the term heart is an English word, cardiac (heart-related) terminology can be traced back to
the Latin term, kardia. Cardiology is the study of the heart, and cardiologists are the physicians who deal
primarily with the heart.
8.2 Heart Anatomy2
The vital importance of the heart is obvious. If one assumes an average rate of contraction of 75 contractions
per minute, a human heart would contract approximately 108,000 times in one day, more than 39 million
times in one year, and nearly 3 billion times during a 75-year lifespan. Each of the major pumping chambers
of the heart ejects approximately 70 mL blood per contraction in a resting adult. This would be equal to
5.25 liters of uid per minute and approximately 14,000 liters per day.
Over one year, that would equal
10,000,000 liters or 2.6 million gallons of blood sent through roughly 60,000 miles of vessels.
In order to
understand how that happens, it is necessary to understand the anatomy and physiology of the heart.
8.2.1 Location of the Heart
The human heart is located within the thoracic cavity and is separated from the other structures by a tough
membrane known as the pericardium, or pericardial sac.
CHAPTER 8.

to apply an emergency technique known as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if the heart of
a patient should stop. By applying pressure with the at portion of one hand on the sternum in
compress the blood within the heart enough to push some of the blood within it into the pulmonary
and systemic circuits. This is particularly critical for the brain, as irreversible damage and death
of neurons occur within minutes of loss of blood ow. Current standards call for compression of
the chest at least 5 cm deep and at a rate of 100 compressions per minute, a rate equal to the
beat in Staying Alive, recorded in 1977 by the Bee Gees. If you are unfamiliar with this song,
At this stage, the emphasis is on performing high-
quality chest compressions, rather than providing articial respiration. CPR is generally performed
until the patient regains spontaneous contraction or is declared dead by an experienced healthcare
professional.
When performed by untrained or overzealous individuals, CPR can result in broken ribs or a broken
sternum, and can inict additional severe damage on the patient. It is also possible, if the hands are
placed too low on the sternum, to manually drive the xiphoid process into the liver, a consequence
that may prove fatal for the patient.
Proper training is essential.
This proven life-sustaining
technique is so valuable that virtually all medical personnel as well as concerned members of the
public should be certied and routinely recertied in its application. CPR courses are oered at a
variety of locations, including colleges, hospitals, the American Red Cross, and some commercial
companies. They normally include practice of the compression technique on a mannequin.
CPR Technique
If the heart should stop, CPR can maintain the ow of blood until the heart resumes
beating. By applying pressure to the sternum, the blood within the heart will be squeezed out of the
heart and into the circulation. Proper positioning of the hands on the sternum to perform CPR would
be between the lines at T4 and T9.
CHAPTER 8.
HEART
8.2.2 Shape and Size of the Heart
A typical heart is approximately the size of your st: 12 cm (5 in) in length, 8 cm (3.5 in) wide, and 6 cm
(2.5 in) in thickness. Given the size dierence between most members of the sexes, the weight of a female
heart is approximately 250300 grams (9 to 11 ounces), and the weight of a male heart is approximately
300350 grams (11 to 12 ounces). The heart of a well-trained athlete, especially one specializing in aerobic
sports, can be considerably larger than this. Cardiac muscle responds to exercise in a manner similar to that
of skeletal muscle. That is, exercise results in the addition of protein myolaments that increase the size
of the individual cells without increasing their numbers, a concept called hypertrophy. Hearts of athletes
can pump blood more eectively at lower rates than those of nonathletes. Enlarged hearts are not always a
result of exercise; they can result from diseases, such as
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

a receiving chamber and contracts to push blood into the lower chambers, the right ventricle and the left
ventricle. The ventricles serve as the primary pumping chambers of the heart, propelling blood to the lungs
or to the rest of the body.
There are two distinct but linked circuits in the human circulation called the pulmonary and systemic
circuits. Although both circuits transport blood and everything it carries, we can initially view the circuits
from the point of view of gases. The
pulmonary circuit transports blood to and from the lungs, where it

reaching the pulmonary capillaries, where gas exchange occurs: Carbon dioxide exits the blood and
The right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood into the

oxygen enters. The pulmonary trunk arteries and their branches are the only arteries in the post-natal body
that carry relatively deoxygenated blood. Highly oxygenated blood returning from the pulmonary capillaries
in the lungs passes through a series of vessels that join together to form the
pulmonary veinsthe only
post-natal veins in the body that carry highly oxygenated blood. The pulmonary veins conduct blood into
the left atrium, which pumps the blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps oxygenated blood into
the aorta and on to the many branches of the systemic circuit.
Eventually, these vessels will lead to the
systemic capillaries, where exchange with the tissue uid and cells of the body occurs. In this case, oxygen
and nutrients exit the systemic capillaries to be used by the cells in their metabolic processes, and carbon
dioxide and waste products will enter the blood.
The blood exiting the systemic capillaries is lower in oxygen concentration than when it entered. The
capillaries will ultimately unite to form venules, joining to form ever-larger veins, eventually owing into the
two major systemic veins, the
superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava, which return blood to the
right atrium. The blood in the superior and inferior venae cavae ows into the right atrium, which pumps
blood into the right ventricle. This process of blood circulation continues as long as the individual remains
alive. Understanding the ow of blood through the pulmonary and systemic circuits is critical to all health
Dual System of the Human Blood Circulation
Blood ows from the right atrium to the right ventricle, where it is pumped into the
pulmonary circuit. The blood in the pulmonary artery branches is low in oxygen but relatively high in
carbon dioxide. Gas exchange occurs in the pulmonary capillaries (oxygen into the blood, carbon dioxide
out), and blood high in oxygen and low in carbon dioxide is returned to the left atrium. From here, blood
enters the left ventricle, which pumps it into the systemic circuit. Following exchange in the systemic
capillaries (oxygen and nutrients out of the capillaries and carbon dioxide and wastes in), blood returns
to the right atrium and the cycle is repeated.
CHAPTER 8.
HEART
8.2.4 Membranes, Surface Features, and Layers
8.2.4.1 Layers
The wall of the heart is composed of three layers of unequal thickness. From supercial to deep, these are
the epicardium, the myocardium, and the endocardium. The outermost layer of the wall of the heart is also
the innermost layer of the pericardium, the epicardium, or the visceral pericardium discussed earlier.
The middle and thickest layer is the
myocardium, made largely of cardiac muscle cells. It is built upon
a framework of collagenous bers, plus the blood vessels that supply the myocardium and the nerve bers
that help regulate the heart. It is the contraction of the myocardium that pumps blood through the heart
and into the major arteries. The muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral
around the chambers of the heart. They form a gure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the
great vessels. Deeper ventricular muscles also form a gure 8 around the two ventricles and proceed toward
the apex. More supercial layers of ventricular muscle wrap around both ventricles. This complex swirling
pattern allows the heart to pump blood more eectively than a simple linear pattern would.
(Heart Musculature ) illustrates the arrangement of muscle cells.
Heart Musculature
to pump blood eectively.
Although the ventricles on the right and left sides pump the same amount of blood per contraction, the
muscle of the left ventricle is much thicker and better developed than that of the right ventricle. In order to
overcome the high resistance required to pump blood into the long systemic circuit, the left ventricle must
generate a great amount of pressure. The right ventricle does not need to generate as much pressure, since
Thickness ) illustrates the dierences in muscular thickness needed for each of the ventricles.
Dierences in Ventricular Muscle Thickness
Both ventricles pump the same amount of blood, but the left ventricle must generate a much greater
pressure to overcome greater resistance in the systemic circuit. The ventricles are shown in both relaxed
and contracting states.
Note the dierences in the relative size of the lumens, the region inside each
ventricle where the blood is contained.
8.2.5 Internal Structure of the Heart
Recall that the heart's contraction cycle follows a dual pattern of circulationthe pulmonary and systemic
circuitsbecause of the pairs of chambers that pump blood into the circulation. In order to develop a more
precise understanding of cardiac function, it is rst necessary to explore the internal anatomical structures
in more detail.
8.2.5.1 Septa of the Heart
There are four openings that allow blood to move from the atria into the ventricles and from the ventricles
into the pulmonary trunk and aorta.
Located in each of these openings between the atria and ventricles
valve, a specialized structure that ensures one-way ow of blood. The valves between the atria and
ventricles are known generically as atrioventricular (AV) valves. The valves at the openings that lead to
the pulmonary trunk and aorta are known generically as semilunar valves.

branches, as well as the valves.
8.2.5.2 Right Atrium
The right atrium serves as the receiving chamber for blood returning to the heart from the systemic circulation. The two major systemic veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the large coronary vein called
the coronary sinus that drains the heart myocardium empty into the right atrium. The superior vena cava
drains blood from regions abover the diaphragm: the head, neck, upper limbs, and the thoracic region. It
empties into the superior and posterior portions of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains blood from
areas below the diaphragm: the lower limbs and abdominal and pelvic region of the body. It, too, empties
into the posterior portion of the atria, but is below the opening of the superior vena cava. The majority of
the internal heart structures discussed in this and subsequent sections are illustrated in the provided gure.
The atria receive venous blood on a nearly continuous basis, preventing venous ow from stopping
while the ventricles are contracting. While most ventricular lling occurs while the atria are relaxed, they
do demonstrate a contractile phase and actively pump blood into the ventricles just prior to ventricular
contraction. The opening between the atrium and ventricle is guarded by the tricuspid valve.
8.2.5.3 Right Ventricle
The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve. Each ap of the valve
is attached to strong strands of connective tissue, the
chordae tendineae, literally tendinous cords, or
sometimes more poetically referred to as heart strings. There are several chordae tendineae associated with
each of the aps.
They are composed of approximately 80 percent collagenous bers with the remainder
consisting of elastic bers and endothelium. They connect each of the aps to a
papillary muscle.
When the myocardium of the ventricle contracts, pressure within the ventricular chamber rises. Blood,
like any uid, ows from higher pressure to lower pressure areas, in this case, toward the pulmonary trunk
and the atrium. To prevent any potential backow, the papillary muscles also contract, generating tension on
the chordae tendineae. This prevents the aps of the valves from being forced into the atria and regurgitation

When the right ventricle contracts, it ejects blood into the pulmonary trunk, which branches into the left
and right pulmonary arteries that carry it to each lung. The superior surface of the right ventricle begins to
taper as it approaches the pulmonary trunk. At the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar
valve that prevents backow from the pulmonary trunk.
CHAPTER 8.
HEART
8.2.5.4 Left Atrium
After exchange of gases in the pulmonary capillaries, blood returns to the left atrium high in oxygen via
one of the four pulmonary veins. Blood ows nearly continuously from the pulmonary veins back into the
atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most
blood ows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but toward the end of
the ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. This atrial
contraction accounts for approximately 20 percent of ventricular lling. The opening between the left atrium
and ventricle is guarded by the mitral valve.

Thickness )). The mitral valve is connected to papillary muscles via chordae tendineae.
The left ventricle is the major pumping chamber for the systemic circuit; it ejects blood into the aorta
through the aortic semilunar valve.
8.2.5.6 Heart Valve Structure and Function
A transverse section through the heart slightly above the level of the atrioventricular septum reveals all four

additional connective tissue. The aps are connected by chordae tendineae to the papillary muscles, which
control the opening and closing of the valves.
Heart Valves
dicult to distinguish the three separate cusps of the tricuspid valve.
Emerging from the right ventricle at the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve or
the right semilunar valve. The pulmonary valve is comprised of three small aps of endothelium reinforced
with connective tissue. When the ventricle relaxes, the pressure dierential causes blood to ow back into
the ventricle from the pulmonary trunk. This ow of blood lls the pocket-like aps of the pulmonary valve,
causing the valve to close and producing an audible sound ("Lub"). Unlike the atrioventricular valves, there
are no papillary muscles or chordae tendineae associated with the pulmonary valve.
Located at the opening between the left atrium and left ventricle is the mitral valve, also called the
bicuspid valve or the left atrioventricular valve. Structurally, this valve consists of two cusps compared
to the three cusps of the tricuspid valve. In a clinical setting, the valve is referred to as the mitral valve,
rather than the bicuspid valve. The two cusps of the mitral valve are attached by chordae tendineae to two
papillary muscles that project from the wall of the ventricle.
At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve, or the
aortic valve, which prevents backow from
the aorta. It normally is composed of three aps. When the ventricle relaxes and blood attempts to ow
back into the ventricle from the aorta, blood will ll the cusps of the valve, causing it to close and producing

area of lowest pressure, which is initially in the atria. This backow causes the cusps of the tricuspid and
mitral (bicuspid) valves to close. These valves are tied down to the papillary muscles by chordae tendineae.

Although much of the heart has been removed from this gif loop so the
chordae tendineae are not visible, why is their presence more critical for the atrioventricular valves
(tricuspid and mitral) than the semilunar (aortic and pulmonary) valves?
:
Heart Valves
When heart valves do not function properly, they are often described as incompetent and result
in valvular heart disease, which can range from benign to lethal.
Some of these conditions are
congenital, that is, the individual was born with the defect, whereas others may be attributed
to disease processes or trauma.
Some malfunctions are treated with medications, others require
surgery, and still others may be mild enough that the condition is merely monitored since treatment
might trigger more serious consequences.
Valvular disorders are often caused by carditis, or inammation of the heart. One common trigger
for this inammation is rheumatic fever, or scarlet fever, an autoimmune response to the presence
of a bacterium, Streptococcus pyogenes, normally a disease of childhood.
While any of the heart valves may be involved in valve disorders, mitral regurgitation is the most
common, detected in approximately 2 percent of the population, and the pulmonary semilunar
valve is the least frequently involved.
When a valve malfunctions, the ow of blood to a region
will often be disrupted. The resulting inadequate ow of blood to this region will be described in
general terms as an insuciency. The specic type of insuciency is named for the valve involved:
aortic insuciency, mitral insuciency, tricuspid insuciency, or pulmonary insuciency.
If one of the cusps of the valve is forced backward by the force of the blood, the condition is
referred to as a prolapsed valve.
Prolapse may occur if the chordae tendineae are damaged or
broken, causing the closure mechanism to fail. The failure of the valve to close properly disrupts
the normal one-way ow of blood and results in regurgitation, when the blood ows backward from
its normal path. Using a stethoscope, the disruption to the normal ow of blood produces a heart
murmur.
CHAPTER 8.
HEART
Stenosis is a condition in which the heart valves become rigid and may calcify over time. The loss
of exibility of the valve interferes with normal function and may cause the heart to work harder
to propel blood through the valve, which eventually weakens the heart.
Aortic stenosis aects
approximately 2 percent of the population over 65 years of age, and the percentage increases to
approximately 4 percent in individuals over 85 years.
Occasionally, one or more of the chordae
tendineae will tear or the papillary muscle itself may die as a component of a myocardial infarction
(heart attack). In this case, the patient's condition will deteriorate dramatically and rapidly, and
immediate surgical intervention may be required.
Auscultation, or listening to a patient's heart sounds, is one of the most useful diagnostic tools, since
it is proven, safe, and inexpensive. The term auscultation is derived from the Latin for to listen,
and the technique has been used for diagnostic purposes as far back as the ancient Egyptians.
Valve and septal disorders will trigger abnormal heart sounds. If a valvular disorder is detected or
suspected, a test called an echocardiogram, or simply an echo, may be ordered. Echocardiograms
are sonograms of the heart and can help in the diagnosis of valve disorders as well as a wide variety
of heart pathologies.

Cardiologist
Cardiologists are medical doctors that specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the
heart.
After completing 4 years of medical school, cardiologists complete a three-year residency
in internal medicine followed by an additional three or more years in cardiology.
Following this
10-year period of medical training and clinical experience, they qualify for a rigorous two-day examination administered by the Board of Internal Medicine that tests their academic training and
clinical abilities, including diagnostics and treatment. After successful completion of this examination, a physician becomes a board-certied cardiologist. Some board-certied cardiologists may be
invited to become a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology (FACC). This professional recognition is awarded to outstanding physicians based upon merit, including outstanding credentials,
achievements, and community contributions to cardiovascular medicine.

Cardiovascular Technologist/Technician
Cardiovascular technologists/technicians are trained professionals who perform a variety of imaging
techniques, such as sonograms or echocardiograms, used by physicians to diagnose and treat diseases
of the heart. Nearly all of these positions require an associate degree, and these technicians earn a
median salary of $49,410 as of May 2010, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Growth
within the eld is fast, projected at 29 percent from 2010 to 2020.
There is a considerable overlap and complementary skills between cardiac technicians and vascular
technicians, and so the term cardiovascular technician is often used. Special certications within
the eld require documenting appropriate experience and completing additional and often expensive certication examinations. These subspecialties include Certied Rhythm Analysis Technician

8.2.6 Coronary Circulation
You will recall that the heart is a remarkable pump composed largely of cardiac muscle cells that are
incredibly active throughout life. Like all other cells, a
cardiomyocyte requires a reliable supply of oxygen
and nutrients, and a way to remove wastes, so it needs a dedicated, complex, and extensive coronary
circulation. And because of the critical and nearly ceaseless activity of the heart throughout life, this need
for a blood supply is even greater than for a typical cell. However, coronary circulation is not continuous;
rather, it cycles, reaching a peak when the heart muscle is relaxed and nearly ceasing while it is contracting.
CHAPTER 8.
HEART
8.2.6.1 Coronary Arteries and Veins
Coronary arteries supply blood to the myocardium and other components of the heart. The rst portion
of the aorta after it arises from the left ventricle gives rise to the coronary arteries (right and left), which
bring freshly oxygenated blood to the tissues of both sides of the heart. A coronary artery blockage often
results in death of the cells (due to myocardial infarction/heart attack) supplied by the particular blood
vessel.
:
Coronary veins drain the heart and generally parallel the large surface arteries.
Heart: Myocardial Infarction
Myocardial infarction (MI) is the formal term for what is commonly referred to as a heart attack.
It normally results from a lack of blood ow (ischemia) and oxygen (hypoxia) to a region of the
heart, resulting in death of the cardiac muscle cells. An MI often occurs when a coronary artery
is blocked by the buildup of atherosclerotic plaque consisting of lipids, cholesterol and fatty acids,
and white blood cells, primarily macrophages.
It can also occur when a portion of an unstable
atherosclerotic plaque travels through the coronary arterial system and lodges in one of the smaller
vessels. The resulting blockage restricts the ow of blood and oxygen to the myocardium and causes
death of the tissue. MIs may be triggered by excessive exercise, in which the partially occluded
artery is no longer able to pump sucient quantities of blood, or severe stress, which may induce
spasm of the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessel.
In the case of acute MI, there is often sudden pain beneath the sternum called angina pectoris,
often radiating down the left arm in males but not in female patients. Until this anomaly between
the sexes was discovered, many female patients suering MIs were misdiagnosed and sent home.
In addition, patients typically present with diculty breathing and shortness of breath, irregular
heartbeat, nausea and vomiting, sweating, anxiety, and fainting, although not all of these symptoms
may be present. Many of the symptoms are shared with other medical conditions, including anxiety
attacks and simple indigestion, so dierential diagnosis is critical. It is estimated that between 22
and 64 percent of MIs present without any symptoms.
Immediate treatments for MI are essential and include administering supplemental oxygen, aspirin
that helps to break up clots, and nitroglycerine administered sublingually (under the tongue) to
facilitate its absorption. Despite its unquestioned success in treatments and use since the 1880s, the
mechanism of nitroglycerine is still incompletely understood but is believed to involve the release of
nitric oxide, a known vasodilator, and endothelium-derived releasing factor, which also relaxes the
smooth muscle in the tunica media of coronary vessels. Longer-term treatments include injections of
thrombolytic agents such as streptokinase that dissolve the clot, the anticoagulant heparin, balloon
angioplasty and stents to open blocked vessels, and bypass surgery to allow blood to pass around the
site of blockage. If the damage is extensive, coronary replacement with a donor heart or coronary
assist device, a sophisticated mechanical device that supplements the pumping activity of the heart,
may be employed. Despite the attention, development of articial hearts to augment the severely
limited supply of heart donors has proven less than satisfactory but will likely improve in the future.
8.2.6.2 Coronary Artery Disease
:
Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. It occurs when the buildup
of plaquea fatty material including cholesterol, connective tissue, white blood cells, and some
smooth muscle cellswithin the walls of the arteries obstructs the ow of blood and decreases
the exibility or compliance of the vessels.
This condition is called atherosclerosis, a hardening
of the arteries that involves the accumulation of plaque.
As the coronary blood vessels become
occluded, the ow of blood to the tissues will be restricted, a condition called ischemia that causes
the cells to receive insucient amounts of oxygen, called hypoxia.
Coronary Arteries ) shows the blockage of coronary arteries highlighted by the injection of dye.
Some individuals with coronary artery disease report pain radiating from the chest called angina
pectoris, but others remain asymptomatic. If untreated, coronary artery disease can lead to MI or
a heart attack.
Atherosclerotic Coronary Arteries
Such blockages can lead to decreased blood ow (ischemia) and insucient oxygen (hypoxia) delivered
to the cardiac tissues. If uncorrected, this can lead to cardiac muscle death (myocardial infarction).
The disease progresses slowly and often begins in children and can be seen as fatty streaks in
the vessels.
It then gradually progresses throughout life.
Well-documented risk factors include
smoking, family history, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, high alcohol consumption, lack of exercise,
stress, and hyperlipidemia or high circulating levels of lipids in the blood. Treatments may include
medication, changes to diet and exercise, angioplasty with a balloon catheter, insertion of a stent,
or coronary bypass procedure.
CHAPTER 8.
Angioplasty is a procedure in which the occlusion is mechanically widened with a balloon.
HEART
A
specialized catheter with an expandable tip is inserted into a supercial vessel, normally in the leg,
and then directed to the site of the occlusion. At this point, the balloon is inated to compress
the plaque material and to open the vessel to increase blood ow. Then, the balloon is deated
and retracted. A stent consisting of a specialized mesh is typically inserted at the site of occlusion
to reinforce the weakened and damaged walls. Stent insertions have been routine in cardiology for
more than 40 years.
Coronary bypass surgery may also be performed. This surgical procedure grafts a replacement vessel
obtained from another, less vital portion of the body to bypass the occluded area. This procedure is
clearly eective in treating patients experiencing a MI, but overall does not increase longevity. Nor
does it seem advisable in patients with stable although diminished cardiac capacity since frequently
loss of mental acuity occurs following the procedure. Long-term changes to behavior, emphasizing
diet and exercise plus a medicine regime tailored to lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol and
lipids, and reduce clotting are equally as eective.
8.2.7 Chapter Review
The heart resides within the pericardial sac. The walls of the heart are composed of three layers of tissue,
including a thick myocardium. The human heart consists of a pair of atria, which receive blood and pump
it into a pair of ventricles, which pump blood into the vessels.
The right atrium receives systemic blood
relatively low in oxygen and pumps it into the right ventricle, which pumps it into the pulmonary circuit.
Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the lungs, and blood high in oxygen returns to the left
atrium, which pumps blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps blood into the aorta and the
remainder of the systemic circuit. The two openings between the atria and ventricles are guarded by the
atrioventricular valves, the right tricuspid valve and the left mitral valve, which prevent the backow of blood
when the ventricles contract. Each is attached to chordae tendineae that extend to the papillary muscles,
which are extensions of the myocardium, to prevent the valves from being blown back into the atria. The
pulmonary semilunar valve is located at the base of the pulmonary trunk, and the left semilunar valve is
located at the base of the aorta. The right and left coronary arteries are the rst to branch o the aorta.
Cardiac veins parallel the cardiac arteries and eventually drain into the right atrium.
8.3 Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity7
Recall that cardiac muscle shares a few characteristics with both skeletal muscle and smooth muscle, but it
has some unique properties of its own. Not the least of these exceptional properties is its ability to initiate an
electrical potential at a xed rate that spreads rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction mechanism.
This property is known as
autorhythmicity. Neither smooth nor skeletal muscle can do this. Even though
cardiac muscle has autorhythmicity, heart rate is modulated by the endocrine and nervous systems.
8.3.1 Structure of Cardiac Muscle
Compared to the giant cylinders of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, are considerably
shorter with much smaller diameters. Cardiac muscle also demonstrates striations, the alternating pattern
of dark A bands and light I bands attributed to the precise arrangement of the myolaments and brils that
a
elements are virtually identical to skeletal muscle. T (transverse) tubules penetrate from the surface plasma
membrane, the sarcolemma, to the interior of the cell, allowing the electrical impulse to reach the interior.
The T tubules are only found at the Z discs, whereas in skeletal muscle, they are found at the junction of
the A and I bands. Therefore, there are one-half as many T tubules in cardiac muscle as in skeletal muscle.
In addition, the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores few calcium ions, so most of the calcium ions must come from

outside the cells. The result is a slower onset of contraction. Mitochondria are plentiful, providing energy
for the contractions of the heart. Typically, cardiomyocytes have a single, central nucleus, but two or more
nuclei may be found in some cells.
Cardiac muscle cells branch freely. A junction between two adjoining cells is marked by a critical structure
called an

Repair and Replacement
Damaged cardiac muscle cells have extremely limited abilities to repair themselves or to replace dead
cells via mitosis. Recent evidence indicates that at least some stem cells remain within the heart
that continue to divide and at least potentially replace these dead cells. However, newly formed or
CHAPTER 8.
HEART
repaired cells are rarely as functional as the original cells, and cardiac function is reduced. In the
event of a heart attack or MI, dead cells are often replaced by patches of scar tissue. Autopsies
performed on individuals who had successfully received heart transplants show some proliferation
of original cells.
If researchers can unlock the mechanism that generates new cells and restore
full mitotic capabilities to heart muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly
enhanced.
8.3.2 Conduction System of the Heart
If embryonic heart cells are separated into a Petri dish and kept alive, each is capable of generating its
own electrical impulse followed by contraction. When two independently beating embryonic cardiac muscle
cells are placed together, the cell with the higher inherent rate sets the pace, and the impulse spreads from
the faster to the slower cell to trigger a contraction.
As more cells are joined together, the fastest cell
continues to assume control of the rate. A fully developed adult heart maintains the capability of generating
its own electrical impulse, triggered by the fastest cells, as part of the cardiac conduction system.
The
components of the cardiac conduction system include the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atrioventricular (AV)
(Conduction System of the Heart )).
Conduction System of the Heart
Specialized conducting components of the heart include the sinoatrial (SA) node, the
atrioventricular (AV) node, the atrioventricular bundle, the right and left bundle branches, and the
Purkinje bers.
8.3.2.1 Sinoatrial (SA) Node
Normal cardiac rhythm is established by the
sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized clump of myocardial
conducting cells located in the superior and posterior walls of the right atrium in close proximity to the
pacemaker of the heart. It initiates the
sinus rhythm, or normal electrical pattern followed by contraction of the heart.
opening of the superior vena cava. The SA node is known as the
This impulse spreads from its initiation in the SA node throughout the atria to the atrioventricular
(AV) node. The impulse takes approximately 50 ms (milliseconds) to travel between these two nodes. The
connective tissue of the cardiac skeleton prevents the impulse from spreading into the myocardial cells in the
the impulse in the SA node that then spreads the impulse throughout the atria to the atrioventricular node.
CHAPTER 8.
HEART
Cardiac Conduction
(1) The sinoatrial (SA) node and the remainder of the conduction system are at rest.
(2) The SA node initiates the action potential, which sweeps across the atria.
(3) After reaching the
atrioventricular node, there is a delay of approximately 100 ms that allows the atria to complete pumping
blood before the impulse is transmitted to the atrioventricular bundle.
(4) Following the delay, the
impulse travels through the atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches to the Purkinje bers. (5) The
impulse spreads to the contractile bers of the ventricle. (6) Ventricular contraction begins.

portion of the right atrium within the atrioventricular wall. There is a critical pause before the AV node

Purkinje bers are additional myocardial conductive bers that spread the impulse to the myocar-
dial contractile cells in the ventricles. Since the electrical stimulus begins at the apex, the contraction also
begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart, similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from
the bottom. This allows the blood to be pumped out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary
trunk.
8.3.3 Electrocardiogram
By careful placement of surface electrodes on the body, it is possible to record the complex, compound
electrical signal of the heart. This tracing of the electrical signal is the
electrocardiogram (ECG), also
commonly abbreviated EKG (K coming kardiology, from the German term for cardiology). Careful analysis
of the ECG reveals a detailed picture of both normal and abnormal heart function, and is an indispensable
clinical diagnostic tool. The standard electrocardiograph (the instrument that generates an ECG) uses 3,
5, or 12 leads. The greater the number of leads an electrocardiograph uses, the more information the ECG
provides. The term lead may be used to refer to the cable from the electrode to the electrical recorder, but
it typically describes the voltage dierence between two of the electrodes. The 12-lead electrocardiograph

interval is labeled and corresponds to important electrical events, demonstrating the relationship between
these events and contraction in the heart.
There are ve prominent points on the ECG: the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave. The small
P wave represents the depolarization of the atria. The atria begin contracting approximately 25 ms after
the start of the P wave. The large QRS complex represents the depolarization of the ventricles, which
requires a much stronger electrical signal because of the larger size of the ventricular cardiac muscle. The
ventricles begin to contract as the QRS reaches the peak of the R wave.
Lastly, the
T wave represents
the repolarization of the ventricles. The repolarization of the atria occurs during the QRS complex, which
masks it on an ECG.

While interpretation of an ECG is possible and extremely valuable after some training, a full
understanding of the complexities and intricacies generally requires several years of experience. In
general, the size of the electrical variations, the duration of the events, and detailed analysis provide
the most comprehensive picture of cardiac function. For example, an amplied P wave may indicate
enlargement of the atria and an enlarged Q wave may indicate a MI (Myocardial Infarction). T
waves often appear atter when insucient oxygen is being delivered to the myocardium.
As useful as analyzing these electrical recordings may be, there are limitations. For example, not all
areas suering a MI may be obvious on the ECG. Additionally, it will not reveal the eectiveness of
the pumping, which requires further testing, such as an ultrasound test called an echocardiogram
or nuclear medicine imaging. Common abnormalities that may be detected by the ECGs are shown

When arrhythmias become a chronic problem, the heart maintains a junctional rhythm, which originates in
the AV node. In order to speed up the heart rate and restore full sinus rhythm, a cardiologist can implant
an
articial pacemaker, which delivers electrical impulses to the heart muscle to ensure that the heart
continues to contract and pump blood eectively.
These articial pacemakers are programmable by the
cardiologists and can either provide stimulation temporarily upon demand or on a continuous basis. Some
devices also contain built-in debrillators.
8.3.4 Chapter Review
The heart is regulated by both neural and endocrine (i.e. hormonal) control, yet it is capable of initiating its
own action potential followed by muscular contraction. The conductive cells within the heart establish the
heart rate and transmit it through the myocardium. The contractile cells contract and propel the blood. The
normal path of transmission for the conductive cells is the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node,
atrioventricular (AV) bundle, bundle branches, and Purkinje bers. Recognizable points on the ECG include

8.4 Cardiac Cycle9
The period of time that begins with contraction of the atria and ends with ventricular relaxation is known as
systole. The period of relaxation that occurs as
the chambers ll with blood is called diastole. Both the atria and ventricles undergo systole and diastole,

CHAPTER 8.
HEART
8.4.1 Pressures and Flow
Fluids, whether gases or liquids, are materials that ow according to pressure gradientsthat is, they move
from regions that are higher in pressure to regions that are lower in pressure. Accordingly, when the heart
chambers are relaxed (diastole), blood will ow into the atria from the veins, which are higher in pressure.
As blood ows into the atria, the pressure will rise, so the blood will initially move passively from the atria
into the ventricles. When the action potential triggers the muscles in the atria to contract (atrial systole),
the pressure within the atria rises further, pumping blood into the ventricles. During ventricular systole,
pressure rises in the ventricles, pumping blood into the pulmonary trunk from the right ventricle and into
the aorta from the left ventricle. Again, as you consider this ow and relate it to the conduction pathway,
the elegance of the system should become apparent.
8.4.2 Phases of the Cardiac Cycle
At the beginning of the cardiac cycle, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed (diastole). Blood is owing
into the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus. Blood ows into
the left atrium from the four pulmonary veins.
The two atrioventricular valves, the tricuspid and mitral
valves, are both open, so blood ows unimpeded from the atria and into the ventricles. Approximately 7080
percent of ventricular lling occurs by this method. The two semilunar valves, the pulmonary and aortic
valves, are closed, preventing backow of blood into the right and left ventricles from the pulmonary trunk
on the right and the aorta on the left.
8.4.2.1 Atrial Systole and Diastole
Contraction of the atria follows depolarization, represented by the P wave of the ECG. As the atrial muscles
contract from the superior portion of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum, pressure rises within the
atria and blood is pumped into the ventricles through the open atrioventricular (tricuspid, and mitral or
bicuspid) valves. At the start of atrial systole, the ventricles are normally lled with approximately 7080
percent of their capacity due to inow during diastole.

known as the
end diastolic volume (EDV) or preload.
This volume is
Initially, as the muscles in the ventricle contract, the pressure of the blood within the chamber rises, but
it is not yet high enough to open the semilunar (pulmonary and aortic) valves and be ejected from the heart.
However, blood pressure quickly rises above that of the atria that are now relaxed and in diastole.
This
increase in pressure causes blood to ow back toward the atria, closing the tricuspid and mitral valves.
In the second phase of ventricular systole, the contraction of the ventricular muscle has raised the pressure
within the ventricle to the point that it is greater than the pressures in the pulmonary trunk and the
aorta. Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves. Pressure
generated by the left ventricle will be appreciably greater than the pressure generated by the right ventricle,
since the existing pressure in the aorta will be so much higher. Nevertheless, both ventricles pump the same
amount of blood.
8.4.2.3 Ventricular Diastole
Ventricular relaxation, or diastole, follows repolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the T wave
of the ECG.
During the early phase of ventricular diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure on the remaining
blood within the ventricle begins to fall. When pressure within the ventricles drops below pressure in both
the pulmonary trunk and aorta, blood ows back toward the heart. The semilunar valves close to prevent
backow into the heart.
In the second phase of ventricular diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure on the blood within
the ventricles drops even further. Eventually, it drops below the pressure in the atria. When this occurs,
blood ows from the atria into the ventricles, pushing open the tricuspid and mitral valves.
As pressure
drops within the ventricles, blood ows from the major veins into the relaxed atria and from there into the
ventricles.

8.4.3 Heart Sounds
One of the simplest, yet eective, diagnostic techniques applied to assess the state of a patient's heart is
auscultation using a stethoscope.
CHAPTER 8.
In a normal, healthy heart, there are only two audible
HEART
heart sounds: Lub and Dup (or Dub). Lub,
or rst heart sound is the sound created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular
contraction . The second heart sound,"Dup" (or "Dub") is the sound of the closing of the semilunar valves
during ventricular diastole.
The term
murmur is used to describe an unusual sound coming from the heart that is caused by the
turbulent ow of blood. Murmurs are graded on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being the most common, the most
dicult sound to detect, and the least serious. The most severe is a 6. Specialized electronic stethoscopes
are used to record both normal and abnormal sounds.
When using a stethoscope to listen to the heart sounds, called asculation, it is common practice for the
clinician to ask the patient to breathe deeply. This procedure not only allows for listening to airow, but
it may also amplify heart murmurs.
Inhalation increases blood ow into the right side of the heart and
may increase the amplitude of right-sided heart murmurs. Expiration partially restricts blood ow into the

8.4.4 Chapter Review
The cardiac cycle comprises a complete relaxation and contraction of both the atria and ventricles, and lasts
approximately 0.8 seconds. Beginning with all chambers in diastole, blood ows passively from the veins
into the atria and past the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles.
The atria begin to contract (atrial
systole), following depolarization of the atria, and pump blood into the ventricles. The ventricles begin to
contract (ventricular systole), raising pressure within the ventricles. When ventricular pressure rises above
the pressure in the atria, blood ows toward the atria, producing the rst heart sound, lub. As pressure
in the ventricles rises above two major arteries, blood pushes open the two semilunar valves and moves
into the pulmonary trunk and aorta in the ventricular ejection phase. Following ventricular repolarization,
the ventricles begin to relax (ventricular diastole), and pressure within the ventricles drops. As ventricular
pressure drops, there is a tendency for blood to ow back into the atria from the major arteries, closing

HEART
the two semilunar valves. The second heart sound, dub (or dup) , occurs when the semilunar valves close.
When the pressure falls below that of the atria, blood moves from the atria into the ventricles, opening the
atrioventricular valves and marking one complete heart cycle. The valves prevent backow of blood. Failure
of the valves to operate properly produces turbulent blood ow within the heart; the resulting heart murmur
can often be heard with a stethoscope.

note:
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Compare and contrast the anatomical structure of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and
veins
• Accurately describe the forces that account for capillary exchange
• Describe the interaction of the cardiovascular system with other body systems
• Identify and describe the hepatic portal system
In this chapter, you will learn about the vascular part of the cardiovascular system, that is, the vessels
that transport blood throughout the body and provide the physical site where gases, nutrients, and other
substances are exchanged with body cells. When vessel functioning is reduced, blood-borne substances do
not circulate eectively throughout the body. As a result, tissue injury occurs, metabolism is impaired, and
the functions of every bodily system are threatened.
9.2 Structure and Function of Blood Vessels2
Blood is carried through the body via blood vessels. An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away
from the heart, where it branches into ever-smaller vessels. Eventually, the smallest arteries, vessels called
arterioles, further branch into tiny capillaries, where nutrients and wastes are exchanged, and then combine
with other vessels that exit capillaries to form venules, small blood vessels that carry blood to a vein, a larger
blood vessel that returns blood to the heart.
Arteries and veins transport blood in two distinct circuits:
the systemic circuit and the pulmonary
Systemic arteries provide blood rich in oxygen to the
body's tissues. The blood returned to the heart through systemic veins has less oxygen, since much of the
oxygen carried by the arteries has been delivered to the cells. In contrast, in the pulmonary circuit, arteries
carry blood low in oxygen exclusively to the lungs for gas exchange. Pulmonary veins then return freshly
oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart to be pumped back out into systemic circulation. Although
arteries and veins dier structurally and functionally, they share certain features.
CHAPTER 9.
BLOOD VESSELS

to the heart. The systemic circuit moves blood from the left side of the heart to the head and body and
returns it to the right side of the heart to repeat the cycle. The arrows indicate the direction of blood
ow, and the colors show the relative levels of oxygen concentration.
9.2.1 Shared Structures
Dierent types of blood vessels vary slightly in their structures, but they share the same general features.
Arteries and arterioles have thicker walls than veins and venules because they are closer to the heart and
of vessel has a
lumena hollow passageway through which blood ows. Arteries have smaller lumens than
veins, a characteristic that helps to maintain the pressure of blood moving through the system. Together,
their thicker walls and smaller diameters give arterial lumens a more rounded appearance in cross section
than the lumens of veins.

thicker because of the higher pressure of the blood that ows through them. (c) A micrograph shows the

CHAPTER 9.
BLOOD VESSELS
By the time blood has passed through capillaries and entered venules, the pressure initially exerted
upon it by heart contractions has diminished. In other words, in comparison to arteries, venules and veins
withstand a much lower pressure from the blood that ows through them.
Their walls are considerably
thinner and their lumens are correspondingly larger in diameter, allowing more blood to ow with less vessel
resistance. In addition, many veins of the body, particularly those of the limbs, contain valves that assist
the unidirectional ow of blood toward the heart. This is critical because blood ow becomes sluggish in the
extremities, as a result of the lower pressure and the eects of gravity.
9.2.2 Capillaries
A
capillary is a microscopic channel that supplies blood to the tissues themselves. Exchange of gases and
other substances occurs in the capillaries between the blood and the surrounding cells and their tissue uid
(interstitial uid). The diameter of a capillary lumen ranges from 510 micrometers; the smallest are just
barely wide enough for an erythrocyte to squeeze through.
9.2.3 Chapter Review
Blood pumped by the heart ows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules,
and veins before returning to the heart. Arteries transport blood away from the heart and branch into smaller
vessels, forming arterioles. Arterioles distribute blood to capillary beds, the sites of exchange with the body
tissues. Capillaries lead back to small vessels known as venules that ow into the larger veins and eventually
back to the heart.
The arterial system is a relatively high-pressure system, so arteries have thick walls with more elastic
bers that appear round in cross section. The venous system is a lower-pressure system, containing veins
that have larger lumens and thinner walls. They often appear attened.

RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• List the structures of the respiratory system
• List the major functions of the respiratory system
• Outline the forces that allow for air movement into and out of the lungs
• Outline the process of gas exchange
• Summarize the process of oxygen and carbon dioxide transport within the respiratory system
• Discuss how the respiratory system responds to exercise
Hold your breath. Really! See how long you can hold your breath as you continue reading. . .How long can
you do it?
Chances are you are feeling uncomfortable already.
A typical human cannot survive without
breathing for more than 3 minutes, and even if you wanted to hold your breath longer, your autonomic
nervous system would take control. This is because every cell in the body needs to run the oxidative stages
of cellular respiration, the process by which energy is produced in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
For oxidative phosphorylation to occur, oxygen is used as a reactant and carbon dioxide is released as a waste
product. You may be surprised to learn that although oxygen is a critical need for cells, it is actually the
accumulation of carbon dioxide that primarily drives your need to breathe. Carbon dioxide is exhaled and
oxygen is inhaled through the respiratory system, which includes muscles to move air into and out of the
lungs, passageways through which air moves, and microscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries.
The circulatory system transports gases from the lungs to tissues throughout the body and vice versa.
A variety of diseases can aect the respiratory system, such as asthma, emphysema, chronic obstruction
pulmonary disorder (COPD), and lung cancer. All of these conditions aect the gas exchange process and
result in labored breathing and other diculties.
10.2 Organs and Structures of the Respiratory System2
The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily to provide oxygen to body tissues for cellular
respiration, remove the waste product carbon dioxide, and help to maintain acid-base balance. Portions of
the respiratory system are also used for non-vital functions, such as sensing odors, speech production, and
Major Respiratory Structures
10.2.1
10.2.1.1 The Nose and its Adjacent Structures
The major entrance and exit for the respiratory system is through the nose, via the nostrils. The inhaled
air enters into the nasal cavity, which is separated into left and right sections by the nasal septum.
The
wall of the nasal cavity has three bony projections, called the superior, middle, and inferior nasal conchae.
Conchae serve to increase the surface area of the nasal cavity and to disrupt the ow of air as it enters the
nose, causing air to bounce along the epithelium, where it is ltered, warmed, and humidied. Air exits the
nasal cavities and moves into the pharynx.
Several bones that help form the walls of the nasal cavity have air-containing spaces called the sinuses,
which serve to warm and humidify incoming air. Sinuses are lined with a mucosa. Each
sinus is named

for its associated bone: frontal sinus, maxillary sinus, sphenoidal sinus, and ethmoidal sinus. The sinuses

Portions of the nasal cavities are lined with mucous membranes, containing sebaceous glands and hair
follicles that serve to prevent the passage of large debris, such as dirt, through the nasal cavity.
The conchae and sinuses are lined by
respiratory epithelium composed of pseudostratied ciliated
cilia of the respiratory epithelium help remove the mucus and debris from the nasal cavity with a constant
beating motion, sweeping materials towards the throat to be swallowed.
Interestingly, cold air slows the
movement of the cilia, resulting in accumulation of mucus that may in turn lead to a runny nose during
cold weather. This moist epithelium functions to warm and humidify incoming air. Capillaries located just
beneath the nasal epithelium warm the incoming air.

collection of tissue similar to a lymph node that lies at the top portion of the nasopharynx. The function
of the pharyngeal tonsil is not well understood, but it contains a rich supply of lymphocytes (a type of
WBC) and is covered with ciliated epithelium that traps and destroys invading pathogens that enter during
inhalation.
The pharyngeal tonsils are large in children, but interestingly, tend to regress with age and
may even disappear. The uvula is a small bulbous, teardrop-shaped structure located at the apex of the
soft palate. Both the uvula and soft palate move like a pendulum during swallowing, swinging upward to
close o the nasopharynx to prevent ingested materials from entering the nasal cavity. In addition, auditory
(Eustachian) tubes that connect to each middle ear cavity open into the nasopharynx. This connection is
why colds often lead to ear infections.
The
oropharynx is a passageway for both air and food. It contains two distinct sets of tonsils, the
palatine and lingual tonsils. Similar to the pharyngeal tonsil, the palatine and lingual tonsils are composed
of lymphoid tissue, and trap and destroy pathogens entering the body through the oral or nasal cavities.

The
epiglottis, attached to the thyroid cartilage, is a very exible piece of elastic cartilage that covers
the opening of the trachea (see ). When in the closed position, the unattached end of the epiglottis rests
on the glottis. The
glottis is composed of the vestibular folds, the true vocal cords, and the space between
to produce sound.
The size of the membranous folds of the true vocal cords diers between individuals,
producing voices with dierent pitch ranges. Folds in males tend to be larger than those in females, which
create a deeper voice.
The act of swallowing causes the pharynx and larynx to lift upward, allowing the
pharynx to expand and the epiglottis of the larynx to swing downward, closing the opening to the trachea.
These movements produce a larger area for food to pass through, while preventing food and beverages from
entering the trachea.

Respiratory System Disorder: Asthma
Asthma is common condition that aects the lungs in both adults and children. Approximately 8.2
percent of adults (18.7 million) and 9.4 percent of children (7 million) in the United States suer
from asthma. In addition, asthma is the most frequent cause of hospitalization in children.
Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by inammation and uid accumulation of the airway,
and bronchospasms (that is, constriction of the bronchioles), which can inhibit air from entering
the lungs. In addition, excessive mucus secretion can occur, which further contributes to blockage
of the airway.
Bronchospasms occur periodically and lead to an asthma attack.
An attack may be triggered
by environmental factors such as dust, pollen, pet hair, or dander, changes in the weather, mold,
tobacco smoke, and respiratory infections, or by exercise and stress.
Symptoms of an asthma attack involve coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, and tightness of
the chest. Symptoms of a severe asthma attack that requires immediate medical attention would
include diculty breathing that results in blue (cyanotic) lips or face, confusion, drowsiness, a
rapid pulse, sweating, and severe anxiety. The severity of the condition, frequency of attacks, and
identied triggers inuence the type of medication that an individual may require. Longer-term
treatments are used for those with more severe asthma.
Short-term, fast-acting drugs that are
used to treat an asthma attack are typically administered via an inhaler. For young children or
individuals who have diculty using an inhaler, asthma medications can be administered via a
nebulizer.

10.3 Gas Pressure, Volume, and Breathing6
Breathing can be described as the movement of air into (inspiration/inhalation) and out of the lungs (expiration/exhalation). The major mechanism that drive breathing is dierences between atmospheric pressure
and the air pressure within the lungs.
10.3.1 Relationship Between Pressure and Volume
10.3.1.1
Inspiration (or inhalation) and expiration (or exhalation) are dependent on the dierences in pressure between
the atmosphere and the lungs. In a gas, pressure is a force created by the movement of gas molecules that are
conned. For example, a certain number of gas molecules in a two-liter container has more room than the
exerted by the movement of the gas molecules against the walls of the two-liter container is lower than the
force exerted by the gas molecules in the one-liter container. Therefore, the pressure is lower in the two-liter
container and higher in the one-liter container. At a constant temperature, changing the volume occupied
by the gas changes the pressure, as does changing the number of gas molecules.
Boyle's law describes the
relationship between volume and pressure in a gas at a constant temperature.
Boyle discovered that the
pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume: If volume increases, pressure decreases. Likewise,
if volume decreases, pressure increases. Pressure and volume are inversely related (P = k/V ). Therefore,
the pressure in the one-liter container (one-half the volume of the two-liter container) would be twice the
pressure in the two-liter container. Boyle's law is expressed by the following formula:
P1 V 1 = P2 V 2
(10.9)
In this formula, P 1 represents the initial pressure and V 1 represents the initial volume, whereas the nal
pressure and volume are represented by P 2 and V 2, respectively. If the two- and one-liter containers were
connected by a tube and the volume of one of the containers were changed, then the gases would move from
higher pressure (lower volume) to lower pressure (higher volume).
Boyle's Law
Atmospheric pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given
surface, such as the body. Atmospheric pressure can be expressed in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), which
is similar to the phrase "inches of mercury" used to describe atmospheric pressure on weather reports. 760
mm Hg is the atmospheric pressure at sea level under highly specic parameters of latitude and temperature.
CHAPTER 10.
RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
10.3.1.2 How Changes in Volume and Pressure are Accomplished During Breathing
In addition to the dierences in pressures, breathing is also dependent upon the contraction and relaxation
of muscle bers of both the diaphragm and thorax.
The lungs themselves are passive during breathing,
meaning they are not involved in creating the movement that helps inspiration and expiration. Contraction
and relaxation of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles (found between the ribs) cause most of the pressure
changes that result in inspiration and expiration. These muscle movements and subsequent pressure changes
cause air to either rush in or be forced out of the lungs.
During inspiration, the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles contract, causing the rib cage to
expand and move outward, and expanding the thoracic cavity and lung volume. This creates a lower pressure
within the lung than that of the atmosphere, causing air to be drawn into the lungs. During expiration, the
diaphragm and intercostals relax, causing the thorax and lungs to recoil. The air pressure within the lungs
increases to above the pressure of the atmosphere, causing air to be forced out of the lungs.
10.3.2 Respiratory Rate
Breathing usually occurs without thought, although at times you can consciously control it, such as when
you swim under water, sing a song, or blow bubbles. The
respiratory rate is the total number of breaths,
or respiratory cycles, that occur each minute. Respiratory rate can be an important indicator of disease,
as the rate may increase or decrease during an illness or in a disease condition.
The respiratory rate is
controlled by the respiratory center located within the brain, which responds primarily to changes in carbon
dioxide, oxygen, and pH levels in the blood.
The normal respiratory rate of a child decreases from birth to adolescence. A child under 1 year of age
has a normal respiratory rate between 30 and 60 breaths per minute, but by the time a child is about 10
years old, the normal rate is closer to 18 to 30. By adolescence, the normal respiratory rate is similar to that
of adults, 12 to 18 breaths per minute.
10.3.3 Chapter Review
The process of breathing is driven by pressure dierences between the lungs and the atmosphere. Atmospheric
pressure is the force exerted by gases present in the atmosphere. Pressure is determined by the volume of
the space occupied by a gas. Air ows when a pressure gradient is created, from a space of higher pressure
to a space of lower pressure. Boyle's law describes the relationship between volume and pressure. A gas is
at lower pressure in a larger volume because the gas molecules have more space to in which to move. The
same quantity of gas in a smaller volume results in gas molecules crowding together, producing increased
pressure.
Pulmonary ventilation consists of the process of inspiration (or inhalation), where air enters the lungs,
and expiration (or exhalation), where air leaves the lungs. During inspiration, the diaphragm and external
intercostal muscles contract, causing the rib cage to expand and move outward, and expanding the thoracic
cavity and lung volume. This creates a lower pressure within the lung than that of the atmosphere, causing
air to be drawn into the lungs. During expiration, the diaphragm and intercostals relax, causing the thorax
and lungs to recoil. The air pressure within the lungs increases to above the pressure of the atmosphere,
causing air to be forced out of the lungs.
Both respiratory rate and depth are controlled by the respiratory centers of the brain, which are stimulated
by factors such as chemical and pH changes in the blood. A rise in carbon dioxide or a decline in oxygen
levels in the blood stimulates an increase in respiratory rate and depth.
10.4 Gas Exchange7
The purpose of the respiratory system is to perform gas exchange. Inhaling provides air to the alveoli for
this gas exchange process. At the respiratory membrane, where the alveolar and capillary walls meet, gases
move across the membranes, with oxygen entering the bloodstream and carbon dioxide exiting. It is through
this mechanism that blood is oxygenated and carbon dioxide, the waste product of cellular respiration, is
removed from the body via exhaling.
10.4.1 Gas Exchange
In order to understand the mechanisms of gas exchange in the lung, it is important to understand the
underlying principles of gases and their behavior. In addition to Boyle's law, several other gas laws help to
describe the behavior of gases.
CHAPTER 10.
RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
10.4.1.1 Gas Laws and Air Composition
Gas molecules exert force on the surfaces with which they are in contact; this force is called pressure. In
natural systems, gases are normally present as a mixture of dierent types of molecules. For example, the
atmosphere consists of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules, and this gaseous
mixture exerts a certain pressure referred to as atmospheric pressure (Table 10.1).
Partial pressure (Px )
is the pressure of a single type of gas in a mixture of gases. For example, in the atmosphere, oxygen exerts a
partial pressure, and nitrogen exerts another partial pressure, independent of the partial pressure of oxygen
Total pressure is the sum of all the partial pressures
of a gaseous mixture.

Partial and Total Pressures of a Gas
gases in a mixture equals the total pressure.
Partial pressure is extremely important in predicting the movement of gases. Recall that gases tend to
equalize their pressure in two regions that are connected. A gas will move from an area where its partial
pressure is higher to an area where its partial pressure is lower. In addition, the greater the partial pressure
dierence between the two areas, the more rapid is the movement of gases.
10.4.1.2 Solubility of Gases in Liquids
Henry's law describes the behavior of gases when they come into contact with a liquid, such as blood.
Henry's law states that the concentration of gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the solubility and
partial pressure of that gas.
The greater the partial pressure of the gas, the greater the number of gas
molecules that will dissolve in the liquid. The concentration of the gas in a liquid is also dependent on the
solubility of the gas in the liquid. For example, although nitrogen is present in the atmosphere, very little
nitrogen dissolves into the blood, because the solubility of nitrogen in blood is very low. The exception to
this occurs in scuba divers; the composition of the compressed air that divers breathe causes nitrogen to have
a higher partial pressure than normal, causing it to dissolve in the blood in greater amounts than normal.
Too much nitrogen in the bloodstream results in a serious condition that can be fatal if not corrected. Gas
molecules establish an equilibrium between those molecules dissolved in liquid and those in air.
The composition of air in the atmosphere and in the alveoli diers. In both cases, the relative concentration of gases is nitrogen > oxygen > water vapor > carbon dioxide. The amount of water vapor present
in alveolar air is greater than that in atmospheric air (Table 10.2). Recall that the respiratory system works
to humidify incoming air, thereby causing the air present in the alveoli to have a greater amount of water
vapor than atmospheric air. In addition, alveolar air contains a greater amount of carbon dioxide and less
oxygen than atmospheric air. This is no surprise, as gas exchange removes oxygen from and adds carbon
dioxide to alveolar air. Both deep and forced breathing cause the alveolar air composition to be changed
more rapidly than during quiet breathing. As a result, the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide
change, aecting the diusion process that moves these materials across the membrane.
This will cause
oxygen to enter and carbon dioxide to leave the blood more quickly.

10.4.2 Gas Exchange
Gas exchange occurs at two sites in the body: in the lungs, where oxygen is picked up and carbon dioxide
is released at the respiratory membrane, and at the tissues, where oxygen is released and carbon dioxide is
picked up. External respiration is the exchange of gases with the external environment, and occurs in the
alveoli of the lungs. Internal respiration is the exchange of gases with the internal environment, and occurs
in the tissues. The actual exchange of gases occurs due to simple diusion, because molecular oxygen and
carbon dioxide are small and nonpolar.
Energy is not required to move oxygen or carbon dioxide across

membranes.
RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Instead, these gases follow pressure gradients that allow them to diuse.
the lung maximizes the diusion of gases:
The anatomy of
The respiratory membrane is highly permeable to gases; the
respiratory and blood capillary membranes are very thin; and there is a large surface area throughout the
lungs.
10.4.2.1 External Respiration
The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood into the lungs from the heart, where it branches and
eventually becomes the capillary network composed of pulmonary capillaries. These pulmonary capillaries
pumped through this capillary network, gas exchange occurs.
As the blood is
Although a small amount of the oxygen is
able to dissolve directly into plasma from the alveoli, most of the oxygen is picked up by erythrocytes (red
blood cells) and binds to a protein called hemoglobin, a process described later in this chapter. Oxygenated
hemoglobin is red, causing the overall appearance of bright red oxygenated blood, which returns to the heart
through the pulmonary veins. Carbon dioxide is released in the opposite direction of oxygen, from the blood
to the alveoli. Some of the carbon dioxide is returned on hemoglobin, but can also be dissolved in plasma
or is present as a converted form, also explained in greater detail later in this chapter.
External respiration occurs as a function of partial pressure dierences in oxygen and carbon dioxide
between the alveoli and the blood in the pulmonary capillaries.
External Respiration
to the capillary, whereas carbon dioxide diuses out of the capillary into the alveolus.
The partial pressure of carbon dioxide is also dierent between the alveolar air and the blood of the
capillary. However, the partial pressure dierence is less than that of oxygen, about 5 mm Hg. The partial
pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood of the capillary is about 45 mm Hg, whereas its partial pressure
in the alveoli is about 40 mm Hg. However, the solubility of carbon dioxide is much greater than that of
oxygenby a factor of about 20in both blood and alveolar uids. As a result, the relative concentrations
of oxygen and carbon dioxide that diuse across the respiratory membrane are similar.
10.4.2.2 Internal Respiration
Respiration)).
Similar to external respiration, internal respiration also occurs as simple diusion due to
a partial pressure gradient.
However, the partial pressure gradients are opposite of those present at the
respiratory membrane. The partial pressure of oxygen in tissues is low because oxygen is continuously used
for cellular respiration.
In contrast, the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is higher.
This creates
a pressure gradient that causes oxygen to dissociate from hemoglobin, diuse out of the blood, cross the
interstitial space, and enter the tissue.
Hemoglobin that has little oxygen bound to it loses much of its
brightness, so that blood returning to the heart is more burgundy (bluish-red) in color.
Considering that cellular respiration continuously produces carbon dioxide, the partial pressure of carbon
dioxide is lower in the blood than it is in the tissue, causing carbon dioxide to diuse out of the tissue, cross
the interstitial uid, and enter the blood. It is then carried back to the lungs either bound to hemoglobin,
dissolved in plasma, or in a converted form. By the time blood returns to the heart, the partial pressure
of oxygen has returned to about 40 mm Hg, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to
about 45 mm Hg. The blood is then pumped back to the lungs to be oxygenated once again during external
respiration.

Hyperbaric Chamber Treatment
A type of device used in some areas of medicine that exploits the behavior of gases is hyperbaric
chamber treatment. A hyperbaric chamber is a unit that can be sealed and expose a patient to either
100 percent oxygen with increased pressure or a mixture of gases that includes a higher concentration
of oxygen than normal atmospheric air, also at a higher partial pressure than the atmosphere. There
are two major types of chambers: monoplace and multiplace. Monoplace chambers are typically for
one patient, and the sta tending to the patient observes the patient from outside of the chamber
that allow multiple patients to be treated at once, usually in a sitting or reclining position, to help
ease feelings of isolation or claustrophobia.
Multiplace chambers are large enough for multiple
patients to be treated at one time, and the sta attending these patients is present inside the
chamber. In a multiplace chamber, patients are often treated with air via a mask or hood, and the
chamber is pressurized.
Hyperbaric Chamber
Hyperbaric chamber treatment is based on the behavior of gases. As you recall, gases move from
a region of higher partial pressure to a region of lower partial pressure. In a hyperbaric chamber,
the atmospheric pressure is increased, causing a greater amount of oxygen than normal to diuse
into the bloodstream of the patient.
Hyperbaric chamber therapy is used to treat a variety of
medical problems, such as wound and graft healing, anaerobic bacterial infections, and carbon
monoxide poisoning. Exposure to and poisoning by carbon monoxide is dicult to reverse, because
hemoglobin's anity for carbon monoxide is much stronger than its anity for oxygen, causing
carbon monoxide to replace oxygen in the blood. Hyperbaric chamber therapy can treat carbon
monoxide poisoning, because the increased atmospheric pressure causes more oxygen to diuse
into the bloodstream.
At this increased pressure and increased concentration of oxygen, carbon
monoxide is displaced from hemoglobin. Another example is the treatment of anaerobic bacterial
infections, which are created by bacteria that cannot or prefer not to live in the presence of oxygen.
An increase in blood and tissue levels of oxygen helps to kill the anaerobic bacteria that are
responsible for the infection, as oxygen is toxic to anaerobic bacteria.
For wounds and grafts,
the chamber stimulates the healing process by increasing energy production needed for repair.
Increasing oxygen transport allows cells to ramp up cellular respiration and thus ATP production,
the energy needed to build new structures.
10.4.3 Chapter Review
Each specic gas in a mixture of gases exerts force (its partial pressure) independently of the other gases
in the mixture. Gas molecules move down a pressure gradient; in other words, gas moves from a region of
high pressure to a region of low pressure. The partial pressure of oxygen is high in the alveoli and low in the
blood of the pulmonary capillaries. As a result, oxygen diuses across the respiratory membrane from the
alveoli into the blood. In contrast, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is high in the pulmonary capillaries
and low in the alveoli. Therefore, carbon dioxide diuses across the respiratory membrane from the blood
into the alveoli. The amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide that diuses across the respiratory membrane is
similar.
External respiration refers to gas exchange that occurs in the alveoli, whereas internal respiration refers
to gas exchange that occurs in the tissue. Both are driven by partial pressure dierences.
10.5 Transport of Gases8
The other major activity in the lungs is the process of respiration, the process of gas exchange. The function
of respiration is to provide oxygen for use by body cells during cellular respiration and to eliminate carbon
dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, from the body.
In order for the exchange of oxygen and
carbon dioxide to occur, both gases must be transported between the external and internal respiration sites.
Both gases require a specialized transport system for the majority of the gas molecules to be moved between
the lungs and other tissues.
10.5.1 Oxygen Transport in the Blood
The majority of oxygen molecules are carried from the lungs to the body's tissues by a specialized transport
system, which relies on the erythrocytethe red blood cell. Erythrocytes contain hemoglobin, which serves to
of hemoglobin that contains iron, and it is heme that binds oxygen. One erythrocyte contains four iron ions,
and because of this, each erythrocyte is capable of carrying up to four molecules of oxygen. As oxygen diuses
across the respiratory membrane from the alveolus to the capillary, it also diuses into the red blood cell
and is bound by hemoglobin. The following reversible chemical reaction describes the production of the nal
product,
oxyhemoglobin (HbO2 ), which is formed when oxygen binds to hemoglobin. Oxyhemoglobin is
a bright red-colored molecule that contributes to the bright red color of oxygenated blood.
Hb + O2 ↔ Hb
− O2
(10.14)
Erythrocyte and Hemoglobin
10.5.1.1 Function of Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin is composed of subunits, a protein structure that is referred to as a quaternary structure.
Each of the four subunits that make up hemoglobin is arranged in a ring-like fashion, with an iron atom
covalently bound to the heme in the center of each subunit.
When all four heme sites are occupied, the
hemoglobin is said to be saturated. Hemoglobin saturation of 100 percent means that every heme unit in all
of the erythrocytes of the body is bound to oxygen. In a healthy individual with normal hemoglobin levels,
hemoglobin saturation generally ranges from 95 percent to 99 percent.
10.5.2 Carbon Dioxide Transport in the Blood
Carbon dioxide is transported by three major mechanisms. The rst mechanism of carbon dioxide transport is
by blood plasma, as some carbon dioxide molecules dissolve in the blood. The second mechanism is transport

forming carbonic acid (H CO
3 ), which is dissolved in plasma; (c) and in plasma.
10.5.2.1 Dissolved Carbon Dioxide
Although carbon dioxide is not considered to be highly soluble in blood, a small fractionabout 7 to 10
percentof the carbon dioxide that diuses into the blood from the tissues dissolves in plasma. The dissolved
carbon dioxide then travels in the bloodstream and when the blood reaches the pulmonary capillaries, the
dissolved carbon dioxide diuses across the respiratory membrane into the alveoli, where it is then exhaled
during pulmonary ventilation.
10.5.2.2 Bicarbonate Buer
A large fractionabout 70 percentof the carbon dioxide molecules that diuse into the blood is transported
to the lungs as bicarbonate. Most bicarbonate is produced in erythrocytes after carbon dioxide diuses into
the capillaries, and subsequently into red blood cells.
Carbonic anhydrase (CA) causes carbon dioxide and

water to form carbonic acid (H2 CO3 ), which dissociates into two ions: bicarbonate (HCO3 ) and hydrogen
+
(H ). The following formula depicts this reaction:
CO2 + H2 O
CA
↔
+
H2 CO3 ↔ H
+ HCO3−
(10.16)
At the pulmonary capillaries, the chemical reaction that produced bicarbonate (shown above) is reversed,
and carbon dioxide and water are the products. Hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions join to form carbonic
acid, which is converted into carbon dioxide and water by carbonic anhydrase. Carbon dioxide diuses out
of the erythrocytes and into the plasma, where it can further diuse across the respiratory membrane into
the alveoli to be exhaled during pulmonary ventilation.
10.5.2.3 Carbaminohemoglobin
About 20 percent of carbon dioxide is bound by hemoglobin and is transported to the lungs. Carbon dioxide
does not bind to iron as oxygen does; instead, carbon dioxide binds amino acids on the globin portions
of hemoglobin to form
carbaminohemoglobin, which forms when hemoglobin and carbon dioxide bind.
When hemoglobin is not transporting oxygen, it tends to have a bluish-purple tone to it, creating the darker
maroon color typical of deoxygenated blood. The following formula depicts this reversible reaction:
CO2 + Hb ↔ HbCO2
(10.16)
Similar to the transport of oxygen by heme, the binding and dissociation of carbon dioxide to and from
hemoglobin is dependent on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Because carbon dioxide is released from
the lungs, blood that leaves the lungs and reaches body tissues has a lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide
than is found in the tissues.
As a result, carbon dioxide leaves the tissues because of its higher partial
pressure, enters the blood, and then moves into red blood cells, binding to hemoglobin. In contrast, in the
pulmonary capillaries, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is high compared to within the alveoli. As a
result, carbon dioxide dissociates readily from hemoglobin and diuses across the respiratory membrane into
the air.
10.5.3 Chapter Review
Oxygen is primarily transported through the blood by erythrocytes. These cells contain a protein molecule
called hemoglobin, which is composed of four subunits with a ring-like structure. Each subunit contains one
atom of iron bound to a molecule of heme. Heme binds oxygen so that each hemoglobin molecule can bind
up to four oxygen molecules. When all of the heme units in the blood are bound to oxygen, hemoglobin is
considered to be saturated.
Carbon dioxide is transported in blood by three dierent mechanisms: as dissolved carbon dioxide, as
bicarbonate, or as carbaminohemoglobin. A small portion of carbon dioxide remains. The largest amount of
transported carbon dioxide is as bicarbonate, formed in erythrocytes. For this conversion, carbon dioxide is
combined with water with the aid of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. This combination forms carbonic
acid, which spontaneously dissociates into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions.
As bicarbonate builds up in
erythrocytes, it is moved across the membrane into the plasma. At the pulmonary capillaries, bicarbonate
re-enters erythrocytes and the reaction with carbonic anhydrase is reversed, recreating carbon dioxide and
water. Carbon dioxide then diuses out of the erythrocyte and across the respiratory membrane into the
air. An intermediate amount of carbon dioxide binds directly to hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin.

11.1 Endocrine System1
The endocrine system produces hormones that function to control and regulate many dierent body processes.
The endocrine system coordinates with the nervous system to control the functions of the other organ systems.
Cells of the endocrine system produce molecular signals called hormones. These cells may compose endocrine
glands, may be tissues or may be located in organs or tissues that have functions in addition to hormone
production. Hormones circulate throughout the body and stimulate a response in cells that have receptors
able to bind with them. The changes brought about in the receiving cells aect the functioning of the organ
targeted by the hormone. Many of the hormones are secreted in response to signals from the nervous system,
thus the two systems act in concert to eect changes in the body.
11.1.1 Hormones
Maintaining homeostasis within the body requires the coordination of many dierent systems and organs.
One mechanism of communication between neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts
of the body, occurs through the release of chemicals called hormones.
Hormones are released into body
uids, usually blood, which carries them to their target cells where they elicit a response. The cells that
secrete hormones are often located in specic organs, called
endocrine glands, and the cells, tissues, and
organs that secrete hormones make up the endocrine system.
Examples of endocrine organs include the
pancreas, which produces the hormones insulin and glucagon to regulate blood-glucose levels, the adrenal
glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses to stress,
and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates.
The endocrine glands dier from the exocrine glands.
Exocrine glands secrete chemicals through ducts
that lead outside the gland (not to the blood). For example, sweat produced by sweat glands is released into
ducts that carry sweat to the surface of the skin. The pancreas has both endocrine and exocrine functions
because besides releasing hormones into the blood. It also produces digestive juices, which are carried by
ducts into the small intestine.

Endocrinologist
An endocrinologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating endocrine disorders. An endocrine
surgeon specializes in the surgical treatment of endocrine diseases and glands. Some of the diseases
that are managed by endocrinologists include disorders of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus), disorders
of the pituitary (gigantism, acromegaly, and pituitary dwarsm), disorders of the thyroid gland
(goiter and Graves' disease), and disorders of the adrenal glands (Cushing's disease and Addison's
disease).
CHAPTER 11.
HORMONES
Endocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through extensive
use of laboratory tests. Many endocrine diseases are diagnosed using tests that stimulate or suppress
endocrine organ functioning. Blood samples are then drawn to determine the eect of stimulating or
suppressing an endocrine organ on the production of hormones. For example, to diagnose diabetes
mellitus, patients are required to fast for 12 to 24 hours.
They are then given a sugary drink,
which stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin to decrease blood-glucose levels. A blood sample
is taken one to two hours after the sugar drink is consumed. If the pancreas is functioning properly,
the blood-glucose level will be within a normal range. Another example is the A1C test, which can
be performed during blood screening. The A1C test measures average blood-glucose levels over the
past two to three months. The A1C test is an indicator of how well blood glucose is being managed
over a long time.
Once a disease such as diabetes has been diagnosed, endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes
and medications to treat the disease. Some cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise,
weight loss, and a healthy diet; in other cases, medications may be required to enhance insulin's
production or eect. If the disease cannot be controlled by these means, the endocrinologist may
prescribe insulin injections.
In addition to clinical practice, endocrinologists may also be involved in primary research and
development activities. For example, ongoing islet transplant research is investigating how healthy
pancreas islet cells may be transplanted into diabetic patients.
Successful islet transplants may
allow patients to stop taking insulin injections.
11.1.2 How Hormones Work
Hormones cause changes in target cells by binding to specic cell-surface or intracellular hormone receptors, molecules embedded in the cell membrane or oating in the cytoplasm with a binding site that
matches a binding site on the hormone molecule. In this way, even though hormones circulate throughout the
body and come into contact with many dierent cell types, they only aect cells that possess the necessary
receptors. Receptors for a specic hormone may be found on or in many dierent cells or may be limited
to a small number of specialized cells. For example, thyroid hormones act on many dierent tissue types,
stimulating metabolic activity throughout the body. Cells can have many receptors for the same hormone
but often also possess receptors for dierent types of hormones. The number of receptors that respond to a
hormone determines the cell's sensitivity to that hormone, and the resulting cellular response. Additionally,
the number of receptors available to respond to a hormone can change over time, resulting in increased or
decreased cell sensitivity.
11.1.3 Endocrine Glands
The endocrine glands secrete hormones into the surrounding interstitial uid; those hormones then diuse
into blood and are carried to various organs and tissues within the body. The endocrine glands include the
pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal glands, gonads, pineal, and pancreas.

The anterior pituitary produces six hormones: growth hormone, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone,
adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). Growth
hormone stimulates cellular activities like protein synthesis that promote growth. Prolactin stimulates the
production of milk by the mammary glands. The other hormones produced by the anterior pituitary regulate
the production of hormones by other endocrine tissues (Table 11.1). The posterior pituitary is signicantly

It is a buttery-shaped gland with two lobes that are connected. The thyroid follicle cells synthesize the
hormone thyroxine, which is also known as T4 because it contains four atoms of iodine, and triiodothyronine,
also known as T3 because it contains three atoms of iodine. T3 and T4 are released by the thyroid in response
to thyroid-stimulating hormone produced by the anterior pituitary, and both T3 and T4 have the eect of
stimulating metabolic activity in the body and increasing energy use. A third hormone, calcitonin, is also
produced by the thyroid. Calcitonin is released in response to rising calcium ion concentrations in the blood
and has the eect of reducing those levels.

outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla. These regions secrete dierent hormones.
The adrenal cortex produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and gonadocorticoids (principally androgens).
The main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone, which regulates the concentration of ions in urine,
sweat, and saliva.
Aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex is stimulated by a decrease in blood con-
centrations of sodium ions, blood volume, or blood pressure, or by an increase in blood potassium levels.
The glucocorticoids maintain proper blood-glucose levels between meals. They also control a response to
stress by increasing glucose synthesis from fats and proteins and interact with epinephrine to cause vasoconstriction. Androgens are sex hormones that are produced in small amounts by the adrenal cortex. They
do not normally aect sexual characteristics and may supplement sex hormones released from the gonads.
The adrenal medulla contains two types of secretory cells: one that produces epinephrine (adrenaline) and
another that produces norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Epinephrine and norepinephrine cause immediate,
short-term changes in response to stressors, inducing the so-called ght-or-ight response. The responses
include increased heart rate, breathing rate, cardiac muscle contractions, and blood-glucose levels. They also
accelerate the breakdown of glucose in skeletal muscles and stored fats in adipose tissue, and redirect blood
ow toward skeletal muscles and away from skin and viscera. The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine
is stimulated by neural impulses from the sympathetic nervous system that originate from the hypothalamus.
The
pancreas is an elongate organ located between the stomach and the proximal portion of the small
that release hormones.
The endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans.
Among the cell types in each pancreatic islet are the alpha cells, which produce the hormone glucagon, and
the beta cells, which produce the hormone insulin. These hormones regulate blood-glucose levels. Alpha cells
release glucagon as blood-glucose levels decline. When blood-glucose levels rise, beta cells release insulin.
Glucagon causes the release of glucose to the blood from the liver, and insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose
by the body's cells.
The gonads(testes in the male and ovaries in the female)produce steroid hormones.
The testes pro-
duce androgens, testosterone being the most prominent, which allow for the development of secondary sex
characteristics and the production of sperm cells.
The ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone, which
cause secondary sex characteristics, regulate production of eggs, control pregnancy, and prepare the body
for childbirth.
The kidneys also possess endocrine function. Erythropoietin (EPO) is released by kidneys in response
to low blood oxygen levels. EPO triggers an increase in the rate of production of red blood cells in the red
bone marrow. EPO has been used by athletes (e.g. cyclists) to improve performance because more RBCs
mean more oxygen can be transported. However, EPO doping has its risks, because it thickens the blood
and increases strain on the heart; it also increases the risk of blood clots and therefore heart attacks and
stroke.

11.1.4 Regulation of Hormone Production
Hormone production and release are primarily controlled by negative feedback, as described in the discussion
on homeostasis. In this way, the concentration of hormones in blood is maintained within a narrow range.
For example, the anterior pituitary signals the thyroid to release thyroid hormones. Increasing levels of these
hormones in the blood then give feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit further

The posterior pituitary is an extension of the brain and
releases hormones (antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin) produced by the hypothalamus. The thyroid gland
is located in the neck and is composed of two lobes.
The thyroid produces the hormones thyroxine and
triiodothyronine. The thyroid also produces calcitonin. The parathyroid glands lie on the posterior surface
of the thyroid gland and produce parathyroid hormone.
The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and consist of the adrenal cortex and adrenal
medulla. The adrenal cortex produces the glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and gonadocorticoids. The
adrenal medulla is the inner part of the adrenal gland and produces epinephrine and norepinephrine.
The pancreas lies in the abdomen between the stomach and the small intestine. Clusters of endocrine cells
in the pancreas form the islets of Langerhans, which contain alpha cells that release glucagon and beta cells
that release insulin. The kidneys produce erythropoietin. The gonads produce steroid hormones, including
testosterone in males and estrogen and progesterone in females.
12.1 Introduction to the Urinary System1

URINARY SYSTEM
note:
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Describe the composition of urine
• Label structures of the urinary system
• Characterize the roles of each of the parts of the urinary system
• Trace the ow of blood through the kidney
• Outline how blood is ltered in the kidney nephron
• List some of the solutes ltered, secreted, and reabsorbed in dierent parts of the nephron
The urinary system has roles you may be well aware of:
cleansing the blood and ridding the body of
wastes probably come to mind. However, there are additional, equally important functions played by the
system. Take for example, regulation of pH, a function shared with the lungs and the buers in the blood.
Additionally, the regulation of blood pressure is a role shared with the heart and blood vessels.
What
about regulating the concentration of solutes in the blood? Did you know that the kidney is important in
determining the concentration of red blood cells? Eighty-ve percent of the erythropoietin (EPO) produced
to stimulate red blood cell production is produced in the kidneys. The kidneys also perform the nal synthesis
step of vitamin D production.
If the kidneys fail, these functions are compromised or lost altogether, with devastating eects on homeostasis. The aected individual might experience weakness, lethargy, shortness of breath, anemia, widespread
edema (swelling), metabolic acidosis, rising potassium levels, heart arrhythmias, and more. Each of these
functions is vital to your well-being and survival. The urinary system, controlled by the nervous system, also
stores urine until a convenient time for disposal and then provides the anatomical structures to transport
this waste liquid to the outside of the body. Failure of nervous control or the anatomical structures leading
to a loss of control of urination results in a condition called incontinence.
This chapter will help you to understand the anatomy of the urinary system and how it enables the
physiologic functions critical to homeostasis.
It is best to think of the kidney as a regulator of plasma
makeup rather than simply a urine producer. As you read each section, ask yourself this question: What
happens if this does not work? This question will help you to understand how the urinary system maintains
homeostasis and aects all the other systems of the body and the quality of one's life.

The renal corpuscle, located in the renal cortex, is made up of a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus and the capsule, a cup-shaped chamber that surrounds it, called the glomerular or Bowman's capsule.

kidney function.
12.2.3.2 Tubular Reabsorption and Secretion

Almost all nutrients are reabsorbed,

reabsorbed by active transport and then transported to the peritubular capillaries. Because Na

transported out of the tubule, water follows it to even out the osmotic pressure. Water is also independently
reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries due to the presence of aquaporins, or water channels, in the PCT.

By the time the ltrate reaches the DCT, most of the water and solutes have been reabsorbed. If the body
requires additional water, more of it can be reabsorbed at this point. Further reabsorption is controlled by
hormones, which will be discussed in a later section. Excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption
combined with tubular secretion. Undesirable products like metabolic wastes, urea, uric acid, and certain
drugs, are excreted by tubular secretion. Most of the tubular secretion happens in the DCT, but some occurs

in the early part of the collecting duct. Kidneys also maintain an acid-base balance by secreting excess H
ions.

Nephrologist
A nephrologist studies and deals with diseases of the kidneysboth those that cause kidney failure
(such as diabetes) and the conditions that are produced by kidney disease (such as hypertension).
Blood pressure, blood volume, and changes in electrolyte balance come under the purview of a
nephrologist.
Nephrologists usually work with other physicians who refer patients to them or consult with them
about specic diagnoses and treatment plans. Patients are usually referred to a nephrologist for
symptoms such as blood or protein in the urine, very high blood pressure, kidney stones, or renal
failure.
Nephrology is a subspecialty of internal medicine.
To become a nephrologist, medical school is
followed by additional training to become certied in internal medicine. An additional two or more
years is spent specically studying kidney disorders and their accompanying eects on the body.
12.2.4 Section Summary
The kidneys are the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems; they function to lter blood and
maintain the correct concentration of solutes in body uids. They are made up internally of three distinct
regionsthe cortex, medulla, and pelvis.
The blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the kidneys arise from and merge with the aorta
and inferior vena cava, respectively. The renal arteries branch out from the aorta and enter the kidney where
they further divide.
The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, which actively lters blood and generates urine. The
nephron is made up of the renal corpuscle and renal tubule. The nephron lters and exchanges water and
solutes with two sets of blood vessels and the tissue uid in the kidneys.
There are three steps in the formation of urine: glomerular ltration, which occurs in the glomerulus;
tubular reabsorption, which occurs in the renal tubules; and tubular secretion, which also occurs in the renal
tubules.
12.3 Hormonal Control of Urine Concentration5
While the kidneys operate to maintain osmotic balance and blood pressure in the body, they also act in
concert with hormones. Hormones are small molecules that act as messengers within the body. Hormones
are typically secreted from one cell and travel in the bloodstream to aect a target cell in another portion of
the body. Dierent regions of the nephron bear specialized cells that have receptors to respond to chemical
messengers and hormones. In this section, you will learn about two hormones, aldosterone and antidiuretic
hormone, that control urine concentration.
12.3.1 Aldosterone
Aldosterone is a hormone synthesized by the adrenal cortex that aects urine concentration by regulating
sodium levels in the blood. Almost all of the sodium in the blood is reclaimed by the renal tubules under the
inuence of aldosterone. Because sodium is always reabsorbed by active transport and water follows sodium
to maintain osmotic balance, aldosterone manages not only sodium levels but also the water levels in urine.
Aldosterone favors the production of a concentrated urine by the water following the reabsorbed sodium
ions. A decrease in the secretion of aldosterone means that less sodium gets reabsorbed in the renal tubules;
therefore, more of it gets excreted in the urine. Patients who have Addison's disease have a failing adrenal
cortex and cannot produce aldosterone. They lose sodium in their urine constantly, and if the supply is not
replenished, the consequences can be fatal.
12.3.2 Antidiurectic Hormone
Diuretics are drugs that can increase water loss by interfering with the recapture of solutes and water from
the forming urine. They are often prescribed to lower blood pressure. Coee, tea, and alcoholic beverages
are familiar diuretics. Antidiuretic hormone or ADH, as the name suggests, helps the body conserve water
when body uid volume, especially that of blood, is low. It is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored and
released from the posterior pituitary gland. It acts by inserting aquaporins, protein channels that allow water
to leave, in the collecting ducts and promotes reabsorption of water. This action results in the formation of
a concentrated urine. ADH also acts as a vasoconstrictor and increases blood pressure during hemorrhaging.
CHAPTER 12.

12.3.3 Section Summary
Hormonal cues help the kidneys synchronize the osmotic needs of the body. Hormones like aldosterone and
anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) help regulate the needs of the body as well as the communication between the
dierent organ systems.

13.2 Chromosomes and the Genome2
The continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell
cycle. The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events in the life of a cell from the division of a single parent
cell to produce two new daughter cells, to the subsequent division of those daughter cells. The mechanisms
involved in the cell cycle are highly conserved across eukaryotes.
13.2.1 Genomic DNA
Before discussing the steps a cell undertakes to replicate, a deeper understanding of the structure and function
of a cell's genetic information is necessary. A complement of DNA in a gamete is referred to as the
genome.
A somatic cell (i.e. a cell with two sets of chromosomes) contains 2 copies of the genome - one from the
mother's egg and one from the father's sperm. These two copies of the genome are found in the zygote.
with proteins to form complexes called chromosomes. Each species of eukaryote has a characteristic number
of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells. Human body cells (somatic cells) have 46 chromosomes. A somatic
cell contains two matched sets of chromosomes, a conguration known as
diploid. The letter n is used
to represent a single set of chromosomes; therefore a diploid organism is designated 2n. Human cells that
gametes, or sex cells; these eggs and sperm are designated n,

contain one set of 23 chromosomes are called
or
chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus (top), removed from a cell in mitosis (right), and arranged
according to length (left) in an arrangement called a karyotype. In the karyotype, the rst 22 pairs of
chromosomes are called autosomes. The 23rd pair of chromosomes is called the sex chromosomes. A
male has the sex chromosomes X and Y and the female has the sex chromosomes X and X. Therefore, the
human karyotype shown is from a female. In this image, the chromosomes were exposed to uorescent
The matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called
homologous chromosomes. Hogenes in exactly
mologous chromosomes are the same length and have specic nucleotide segments called
the same location, or
loci; singular: locus. Genes, the functional units of chromosomes, determine specic
characteristics by coding for specic proteins. Traits are the dierent forms of a characteristic. For example,
the shape of earlobes is a characteristic with traits of free or attached.
Each copy of the homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a dierent parent; therefore, the copies
of each of the genes themselves may not be identical. The variation of individuals within a species is caused
by the specic combination of the genes inherited from both parents. For example, there are three possible
gene sequences on the human chromosome that codes for blood type: sequence A, sequence B, and sequence
O. Because all diploid human cells have two copies of the chromosome that determines blood type, the blood
type (the trait) is determined by which two versions of the marker gene are inherited. It is possible to have
two copies of the same gene sequence, one on each homologous chromosome (for example, AA, BB, or OO),
or two dierent sequences, such as AB.
Minor variations in traits such as those for blood type, eye color, and height contribute to the natural
variation found within a species. The sex chromosomes, X and Y, are the single exception to the rule of
homologous chromosomes; other than a small amount of homology that is necessary to reliably produce
gametes, the genes found on the X and Y chromosomes are not the same.
CHAPTER 13.
MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS
13.2.2 Section Summary
Eukaryotes have multiple, linear chromosomes surrounded by a nuclear membrane.
Human somatic cells
have 46 chromosomes consisting of two sets of 22 homologous chromosomes and a pair of nonhomologous
sex chromosomes. This is the 2n, or diploid, state. Human gametes have 23 chromosomes or one complete
set of chromosomes. This is the n, or haploid, state. Genes are segments of DNA that code for a specic
protein or RNA molecule. An organism's traits are determined in large part by the genes inherited from
each parent, but also by the environment that they experience. Genes are expressed as characteristics of the
organism and each characteristic may have dierent variants called traits that are caused by dierences in
the DNA sequence for a gene.

A cell moves through a series of phases in an orderly manner.
During interphase, G
involves cell growth and protein synthesis, the S phase involves DNA replication and the replication of the
centrosome, and G
2 involves further growth and protein synthesis. The mitotic phase follows interphase.
Mitosis is nuclear division during which duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into
daughter nuclei.
Usually the cell will divide after mitosis in a process called cytokinesis in which the
cytoplasm is divided and two daughter cells are formed.
13.3.1 Interphase
During interphase, the cell undergoes normal processes while also preparing for cell division. For a cell to
move from interphase to the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three
stages of interphase are called G1 , S, and G2 .
13.3.1.1 G1 Phase
The rst stage of interphase is called the
G1 phase, or rst gap, because little change is visible. However,
during the G1 stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building
blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins, as well as accumulating enough energy reserves to
complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.
CHAPTER 13.
MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS
13.3.1.2 S Phase
Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin conguration. In the
S phase
(synthesis phase), DNA replication results in the formation of two identical copies of each chromosome
sister chromatidsthat are rmly attached at the centromere region.
At this stage, each chromosome is
made of two sister chromatids and is a duplicated chromosome. The centrosome is duplicated during the S
phase.
13.3.1.3 G2 Phase
In the
G2 phase, or second gap, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes the proteins necessary
for chromosome manipulation.
Some cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled
to provide resources for the mitotic spindle.
There may be additional cell growth during G2 .
The nal
preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is able to enter the rst stage of
mitosis.
13.3.2 The Mitotic Phase
To make two daughter cells, the contents of the nucleus and the cytoplasm must be divided. The mitotic
phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and moved to
opposite poles of the cell, and then the cell is divided into two new identical daughter cells. The rst portion
of the mitotic phase,
mitosis, is composed of ve stages, which accomplish nuclear division. The second
cytokinesis, is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components
portion of the mitotic phase, called
into two daughter cells.
13.3.2.1 Mitosis
Mitosis is divided into a series of phasesprophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase

modication of work by the Wadsworth Center, NY
During
prophase, the rst phase, several events must occur to provide access to the chromosomes in the
nucleus. The nuclear envelope starts to break into small vesicles, and the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic
reticulum fragment and disperse to the periphery of the cell. The nucleolus disappears. The centrosomes
begin to move to opposite poles of the cell.
The microtubules that form the basis of the mitotic spindle
extend between the centrosomes, pushing them farther apart as the microtubule bers lengthen. The sister
chromatids begin to coil more tightly and become visible under a light microscope.
During
prometaphase, many processes that were begun in prophase continue to advance and culminate
in the formation of a connection between the chromosomes and cytoskeleton. The remnants of the nuclear
envelope disappear.
The mitotic spindle continues to develop as more microtubules assemble and stretch
across the length of the former nuclear area. Chromosomes become more condensed and visually discrete.
Each sister chromatid attaches to spindle microtubules at the centromere via a protein complex called the
kinetochore.
During metaphase, all of the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the metaphase plate, or the
CHAPTER 13.
MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS
equatorial plane, midway between the two poles of the cell. The sister chromatids are still tightly attached
to each other. At this time, the chromosomes are maximally condensed.
During
anaphase, the sister chromatids at the equatorial plane are split apart at the centromere. Each
chromatid, now called a chromosome, is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule was
attached. The cell becomes visibly elongated as the non-kinetochore microtubules slide against each other
at the metaphase plate where they overlap.
During
telophase, all of the events that set up the duplicated chromosomes for mitosis during the rst
three phases are reversed. The chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense (unravel).
The mitotic spindles are broken down into monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeleton components
for each daughter cell. Nuclear envelopes form around chromosomes.
13.3.2.2 Cytokinesis
Cytokinesis is the second part of the mitotic phase during which cell division is completed by the physical
separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells. Although the stages of mitosis are similar
for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite dierent for eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as
plant cells.
In cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis begins following the onset of anaphase. A
contractile ring composed of actin laments forms just inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase
plate. The actin laments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a ssure. This ssure, or crack, is
called the
cleavage furrow. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane
plasma membrane is drawn in by a ring of bers contracting just inside the membrane. The cleavage
furrow deepens until the cells are pinched in two.
13.3.3 Section Summary
The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series
of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of a long preparatory
period, called interphase. Interphase is divided into G1 , S, and G2 phases. Mitosis consists of ve stages:
prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Mitosis is usually accompanied by cytokinesis,
during which the cytoplasmic components of the daughter cells are separated either by an actin ring (animal
cells) or by cell plate formation (plant cells).
13.3.5 Multiple Choice
13.4 Meiosis and Genetic Variation5
Sexual reproduction requires
fertilization, a union of two haploid cells (i.e. gametes) from two individual
organisms. If those two cells each contain one set of chromosomes, then the resulting cell contains two sets
of chromosomes (i.e.
is diploid).
The number of sets of chromosomes in a cell is called its ploidy level.
Haploid cells contain one set of chromosomes. Cells containing two sets of chromosomes are called diploid.
If the reproductive cycle is to continue, the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets
before fertilization can occur again, or there will be a continual doubling in the number of chromosome sets
in every generation. So, in addition to fertilization, sexual reproduction includes a nuclear division, known as
meiosis, that reduces the number of chromosome sets. Meiosis consists of two division events, called Meiosis
I and Meiosis II.
Most animals and plants are diploid, containing two sets of chromosomes; in each
somatic cell (the
nonreproductive cells of a multicellular organism), the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome
that are referred to as homologous chromosomes. Somatic cells are sometimes referred to as body cells.
Homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing genes for the same traits in identical locations along
their length.
Diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome from each parent; all
together, they are considered a full set of chromosomes. In animals, haploid cells containing a single copy of
each homologous chromosome are found only within gametes. Gametes fuse with another haploid gamete to
produce a diploid cell.
The nuclear division that forms haploid cells, which is called meiosis, is related to mitosis. As you have
learned, mitosis is part of a cell reproduction cycle that results in identical daughter nuclei that are also
genetically identical to the original parent nucleus.
In mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei
contain the same number of chromosome setsdiploid for most plants and animals. Meiosis employs many
of the same mechanisms as mitosis. However, the starting nucleus is always diploid and the nuclei that result
at the end of a meiotic cell division are haploid (n). To achieve the reduction in chromosome number, meiosis
consists of one round of chromosome duplication and two rounds of nuclear division.
Because the events
that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the same stage names
are assigned. However, because there are two rounds of division, the stages are designated with a I or II.
Thus,
meiosis I is the rst round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on.
Meiosis I reduces the number of chromosome sets from two to one (i.e. reductional division). The genetic
information is also mixed during this division to create unique recombinant chromosomes.
Meiosis II, in
which the second round of meiotic division takes place in a way that is similar to mitosis, includes prophase
II, prometaphase II, and so on. Meiosis II produces daughter cells that are haploid in chromosome number
(as in Meiosis I), but with the sister chromatids separated. In other words, there is no further reduction in
chromosome number, thus it is also called equational division.
13.4.1 Interphase
Meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of the G1 , S, and G2 phases, which are nearly identical to
the phases preceding mitosis. The G1 phase is the rst phase of interphase and is focused on cell growth.
In the S phase, the DNA of the chromosomes is replicated. Finally, in the G2 phase, the cell undergoes the
nal preparations for meiosis.
During DNA duplication of the S phase, each chromosome becomes composed of two identical copies
(called sister chromatids) that are held together at the centromere until they are pulled apart during meiosis
II. Again, homologous chromosome pairs separate in meiosis I (i.e. reductional division) and sister chromatids
separate during meiosis II (i.e. equational division).
13.4.2 Meiosis I
Early in prophase I, the chromosomes can be seen clearly microscopically. As the nuclear envelope begins to
break down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair close to each other. The
tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called
synapsis. In synapsis, the genes on the chromatids of
the homologous chromosomes are precisely aligned with each other. An exchange of chromosome segments
crossing over. This process is revealed
between non-sister homologous chromatids occurs and is called
visually after the exchange as
crossing over can result in genetic variability in the gametes.
As prophase I progresses, the close association between homologous chromosomes begins to break down,
and the chromosomes continue to condense, although the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each
other at chiasmata. The number of chiasmata varies with the species and the length of the chromosome. At
because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible.
tetrads
CHAPTER 13.
MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS
The crossover events are the rst source of genetic variation produced by meiosis.
A single crossover
event between homologous non-sister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between
a maternal chromosome and a paternal chromosome.
Now, when that sister chromatid is moved into a
gamete, it will carry some DNA from one parent of the individual and some DNA from the other parent.
The
recombinant sister chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist
before the crossover. It is important to note that crossing over will only produce genetic diversity if there
was diversity between the maternal and paternal chromosomes.
In this illustration of the eects of crossing over, the blue chromosome came from the
individual's father and the red chromosome came from the individual's mother. Crossover occurs between
non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. The result is an exchange of genetic material between
homologous chromosomes. The chromosomes that have a mixture of maternal and paternal sequence that
dier genetically are called recombinant and the chromosomes that are completely paternal or maternal
are called non-recombinant.
Note:
Crossing over can occur several times between the same pair of
homologous chromosomes.
During metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are arranged in the center of the cell with the kinetochores facing opposite poles. The orientation of each pair of homologous chromosomes at the center of the
cell is random. As is discussed later, this too can contribute to genetic variation in the gametes.
This randomness, called independent assortment, is the physical basis for the generation of the second
CHAPTER 13.
MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS
form of genetic variation in ospring. Consider that the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing
organism are originally inherited as two separate sets, one from each parent. Using humans as an example,
one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother. The father provides the other set of
23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the egg. In metaphase I, these pairs line up at the midway point
between the two poles of the cell. Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule ber will encounter
a maternally or paternally inherited chromosome, the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is
random. Any maternally inherited chromosome may face either pole. Any paternally inherited chromosome
may also face either pole. The orientation of each tetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22
tetrads.
In each cell that undergoes meiosis, the arrangement of the tetrads is dierent. The number of variations
depends on the number of chromosomes making up a set.
There are two possibilities for orientation (for
each tetrad); thus, the possible number of alignments equals 2
n where n is the number of chromosomes per
set. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million (2
23 ) possibilities. This number
does not include the variability previously created in the sister chromatids by crossover. Given these two
mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the same genetic
To summarize the genetic consequences of meiosis I: the maternal and paternal genes are recombined by
crossover events occurring on each homologous pair during prophase I; in addition, the random assortment
of tetrads at metaphase produces a unique combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes that will
make their way into the gametes.
= 2. In this case, there are two possible arrangements at the equatorial plane in metaphase I, as shown
in the upper cell of each panel.
These two possible orientations lead to the production of genetically
dierent gametes. With more chromosomes, the number of possible arrangements increases dramatically.
In anaphase I, the spindle bers pull the linked chromosomes apart. The sister chromatids remain tightly
bound together at the centromere. It is the chiasma connections that are broken in anaphase I as the bers
In telophase I, the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles. The remainder of the typical telophase
events may or may not occur depending on the species. In some organisms, the chromosomes decondense
and nuclear envelopes form around the chromatids in telophase I.
Cytokinesis, the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells, occurs without reformation of the nuclei in other organisms. In nearly all animals, cytokinesis separates the cell contents
by a cleavage furrow. At each pole, there is just one member of each pair of the homologous chromosomes,
so only one full set of the chromosomes is present. This is why the cells are considered haploidthere is only
CHAPTER 13.
MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS
one chromosome set, even though there are duplicate copies of the set because each homolog still consists
of two sister chromatids that are still attached to each other. However, although the sister chromatids were
once duplicates of the same chromosome, they are no longer identical at this stage because of crossovers.

13.4.3 Meiosis II
In meiosis II, the connected sister chromatids remaining in the haploid cells from meiosis I will be split to
form four haploid cells. In some species, cells enter a brief interphase, or
interkinesis, that lacks an S phase,
before entering meiosis II. Chromosomes are not duplicated during interkinesis. The two cells produced in
meiosis I go through the events of meiosis II in synchrony. Overall, meiosis II resembles the mitotic division
of a haploid cell.
In prophase II, if the chromosomes decondensed in telophase I, they condense again. If nuclear envelopes
were formed, they fragment into vesicles. The centrosomes duplicated during interkinesis move away from
each other toward opposite poles, and new spindles are formed. In prometaphase II, the nuclear envelopes
are completely broken down, and the spindle is fully formed.
Each sister chromatid forms an individual
kinetochore that attaches to microtubules from opposite poles. In metaphase II, the sister chromatids are
maximally condensed and aligned at the center of the cell. In anaphase II, the sister chromatids are pulled
apart by the spindle bers and move toward opposite poles.
somes. In anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are separated. In prometaphase II, microtubules
attach to individual kinetochores of sister chromatids. In anaphase II, the sister chromatids are separated.
In telophase II, the chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense. Nuclear envelopes
form around the chromosomes. Cytokinesis separates the two cells into four genetically unique haploid cells.
At this point, the nuclei in the newly produced cells are both haploid and have only one copy of the single
set of chromosomes. The cells produced are genetically unique because (assuming there was parental genetic
variation) of the random assortment of paternal and maternal homologs and because of the recombination
of maternal and paternal segments of chromosomeswith their sets of genesthat occurs during crossover.
13.4.4 Comparing Meiosis and Mitosis
Mitosis and meiosis, which are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells, share some similarities,
but also exhibit distinct dierences that lead to their very dierent outcomes. Mitosis is a single nuclear
division that results in two nuclei, usually partitioned into two new cells. The nuclei resulting from a mitotic
division are genetically identical to the original. They have the same number of sets of chromosomes: one
in the case of haploid cells, and two in the case of diploid cells. On the other hand, meiosis is two nuclear
CHAPTER 13.
MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS
divisions that result in four nuclei, usually partitioned into four new cells. The nuclei resulting from meiosis
are never genetically identical, and they contain one chromosome set onlythis is half the number of the
The dierences in the outcomes of meiosis and mitosis occur because of dierences in the behavior of the
chromosomes during each process. Most of these dierences in the processes occur in meiosis I, which is a very
dierent nuclear division than mitosis. In meiosis I, the homologous chromosome pairs become associated
with each other, are bound together, experience chiasmata and crossover between sister chromatids, and line
up along the metaphase plate in tetrads with spindle bers from opposite spindle poles attached to each
kinetochore of a homolog in a tetrad. All of these events occur only in meiosis I, never in mitosis.
Homologous chromosomes move to opposite poles during meiosis I so the number of sets of chromosomes
in each nucleus-to-be is reduced from two to one. For this reason, meiosis I is referred to as a
division. There is no such reduction in ploidy level in mitosis.
Meiosis II is much more analogous to a mitotic division.
reduction
In this case, duplicated chromosomes (only
one set of them) line up at the center of the cell with divided kinetochores attached to spindle bers from
opposite poles. During anaphase II, as in mitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatid
is pulled to one pole and the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole. If it were not for the fact
that there had been crossovers, the two products of each meiosis II division would be identical as in mitosis;
instead, they are dierent because there has always been at least one crossover per chromosome. Meiosis
II is not a reduction division because, although there are fewer copies of the genome in the resulting cells,
there is still one set of chromosomes, as there was at the end of meiosis I.
Cells produced by mitosis will function in dierent parts of the body as a part of growth or replacing
dead or damaged cells. Cells produced by meiosis in animals will only participate in sexual reproduction.

of events that arrange and separate chromosomes into daughter cells.
Meiosis is a series
During the interphase of meiosis,
each chromosome is duplicated. In meiosis, there are two rounds of nuclear division resulting in four nuclei
and usually four haploid daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.
During meiosis, variation in the daughter nuclei is introduced because of crossover in prophase I and random
alignment at metaphase I. The cells that are produced by meiosis are genetically unique.
Meiosis and mitosis share similarities, but have distinct outcomes. Mitotic divisions are single nuclear
divisions that produce daughter nuclei that are genetically identical and have the same number of chromosome
sets as the original cell. Meiotic divisions are two nuclear divisions that produce four daughter nuclei that
are genetically dierent and have one chromosome set rather than the two sets the parent cell had.
The
main dierences between the processes occur in the rst division of meiosis. The homologous chromosomes
separate into dierent nuclei during meiosis I causing a reduction of ploidy level.
The second division of

As the homologous chromosomes are pulled

The gametes formed from these two groups of chromosomes will have a mixture of traits from the individual's

The two divisions are similar in that the chromosomes line up along the metaphase plate individually,
meaning unpaired with other chromosomes (as in meiosis I). In addition, each chromosome consists of two
sister chromatids that will be pulled apart. The two divisions are dierent because in meiosis II there are
half the number of chromosomes that are present in a diploid cell of the same species undergoing mitosis.
This is because meiosis I reduced the number of chromosomes to a haploid state.

Reproductive Systems
14.1 Introduction to the Reproductive Systems1
Ovulation
Following a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), an oocyte (immature egg cell) will be
released into the uterine tube, where it will then be available to be fertilized by a male's sperm. Ovulation
marks the end of the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle and the start of the luteal phase.
note:
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Describe the anatomy of the male and female reproductive systems, including their accessory
structures
• Explain the role of hypothalamic and pituitary hormones in male and female reproductive
function
• Trace the path of a sperm cell from its initial production through fertilization of an oocyte
• Explain the events in the ovary prior to ovulation
Small, uncoordinated, and slick with amniotic uid, a newborn encounters the world outside of her mother's
womb. We do not often consider that a child's birth is proof of the healthy functioning of both her mother's
and father's reproductive systems. Moreover, her parents' endocrine systems had to secrete the appropriate
regulating hormones to induce the production and release of unique male and female gametes, reproductive
cells containing the parents' genetic material (one set of 23 chromosomes). Her parent's reproductive behavior
had to facilitate the transfer of male gametesthe spermto the female reproductive tract at just the right
time to encounter the female gamete, an oocyte (egg). Finally, combination of the gametes (fertilization)
had to occur, followed by implantation and development.
In this chapter, you will explore the male and
female reproductive systems, whose healthy functioning can culminate in the powerful sound of a newborn's
rst cry.
14.2 Male Reproductive Anatomy and Physiology2
14.2.1 Human Reproductive Anatomy
The reproductive tissues of male and female humans develop similarly in utero until about the seventh week
of gestation when a low level of the hormone testosterone is released from the gonads of the developing
male. Testosterone causes the primitive gonads to dierentiate into male sexual organs. When testosterone
is absent, the primitive gonads develop into ovaries. Tissues that produce a penis in males produce a clitoris
in females. The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a female. Thus the male
and female anatomies arise from a divergence in the development of what were once common embryonic
structures.
14.2.1.1 Male Reproductive Anatomy
Proper development of sperm cells requires a temperature slightly lower than the normal body temperature;
therefore, the pair of testes must be suspended outside the pelvic cavity (in the scrotum) so the environment
of the sperm is about 2
◦
C lower than body temperature. If the testes do not descend through the abdominal
cavity during fetal development, the individual has reduced fertility.
The
scrotum houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), and provides passage for blood vessels,
nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. The testes are a pair of male gonads that produce sperm
and reproductive hormones. Coiled in each testis are seminiferous tubules, where sperm production begins.
The
penis erect, in preparation for intercourse.
The organ is inserted into the vagina culminating with an
ejaculation. During orgasm, the accessory organs and glands connected to the testes contract and empty the
semen (containing sperm) into the urethra and the uid is expelled from the body by muscular contractions
causing ejaculation. After intercourse, the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes accid.
Semen is a mixture of sperm (about ve percent of the total) and uids from accessory glands (prostate,
bulbourethral glands, and seminal vesicles) that contribute most of the semen's volume. Sperm are haploid
cells, consisting of a agellum for movement, a neck that contains the cell's energy-producing mitochondria,

the top of the head of the sperm. This structure contains enzymes that can digest the protective coverings
that surround the egg and allow the sperm to fuse with the egg. An ejaculate will contain from two to ve
milliliters of uid and from 50120 million sperm per milliliter.
As seen in this scanning electron micrograph, human sperm has a agellum, neck, and
Sperm cell formation begins in the walls of
seminiferous tubules that are coiled inside the testes
with the least developed sperm at the periphery of the tubule; the cells get pushed closer to the lumen
as maturation continues. The sperm cells are associated with
Sertoli cells that nourish and promote the
Leydig/interstitial
development of the sperm. Other cells present between the walls of the tubules are the
cells, which produce testosterone once the male reaches puberty.
When the sperm have developed agella they leave the seminiferous tubules and enter the epididymis
maturation.
The sperm leave the epididymis and enter the vas deferens, which carries the sperm behind
the bladder, and forms the ejaculatory duct with the duct from the seminal vesicles. During a vasectomy,
a section of the vas deferens is removed, preventing sperm (but not the secretions of the accessory glands)
from being passed out of the body during ejaculation and preventing fertilization. Although a vasectomy is
in many cases reversible via surgery, it is still considered to be a permanent procedure.
The bulk of the semen comes from the accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system.
These are the

The secretions from the accessory glands provide important compounds for the sperm including

14.2.2 Gametogenesis: Spermatogenesis
Gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, involves the process of meiosis.
During meiosis, two
nuclear divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that
were made during an earlier stage of the cell's life cycle. Meiosis and its associated cell divisions produces
haploid (n) cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid (2n)cells. The production
of sperm is called
spermatogenesis.
14.2.2.1 Spermatogenesis
Spermatogenesis occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules, with the most primitive cells at the periphery
Immediately under the
capsule of the tubule are diploid, undierentiated cells. These stem cells, each called a spermatogonium (pl.
spermatogonia), go through mitosis to produce one cell that remains as a stem cell and a second cell called
a primary spermatocyte that will undergo meiosis to produce sperm.
CHAPTER 14.
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS
The diploid primary spermatocyte goes through meiosis I to produce two haploid cells called secondary
spermatocytes. Each secondary spermatocyte divides after meiosis II to produce two cells called spermatids.
The spermatids eventually reach the lumen of the tubule and grow a agellum, becoming sperm cells. Four
sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis.

tubule. The process takes approximately 70 days.

14.2.3 Hormonal Control of Reproduction
The human male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by the interaction of hormones from the
hypothalamus and anterior pituitary with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. In both sexes,
the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary gland. When the
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing
reproductive hormone is required, the hypothalamus sends a
to the anterior pituitary. This causes the release of
hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary into the blood. Although these hormones are named after their
functions in female reproduction, they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling
reproduction. Other hormones have specic functions in the male and female reproductive systems.
14.2.3.1 Male Hormones
At the onset of puberty, the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the rst
time. FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells located in the walls of the seminiferous tubules
cells of Leydig, located in between the walls of the seminiferous tubules, to make and release testosterone
into the testes and the blood.
Testosterone stimulates spermatogenesis. This hormone is also responsible for the secondary sexual
characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence.
The secondary sex characteristics in males
include a deepening of the voice, the growth of facial, axillary, and pubic hair, an increase in muscle bulk,
and the beginnings of the sex drive.
CHAPTER 14.
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS
A negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH, FSH, and LH. In addition, the Sertoli cells
produce the hormone
inhibin, which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high. This
inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down. If the sperm count
reaches a low of 20 million/mL, the Sertoli cells cease the release of inhibin, and the sperm count increases.
14.2.4 Section Summary
The reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally,
and support the growth and development of ospring. Gametogenesis, the production of sperm in the male
(spermatogenesis), takes place through the process of meiosis.
The male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by hormones released from the hypothalamus
and anterior pituitary and hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. The hypothalamus monitors the
need for FSH and LH production and release from the anterior pituitary. FSH and LH aect reproductive
structures to cause the formation of sperm and the preparation of eggs for release and possible fertilization.
In the male, FSH and LH stimulate Sertoli cells and interstitial cells of Leydig in the testes to facilitate
sperm production. The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which also is responsible for the secondary sexual
characteristics of males. In females, FSH and LH cause estrogen and progesterone to be produced. They
regulate the female reproductive cycle, which is divided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle.

A number of female reproductive structures are exterior to the body.
vulva, which consists of the mons pubis,
These include the breasts and the
work by Gray's Anatomy; credit b: modication of work by CDC)
The breasts consist of mammary glands and fat. Each gland consists of 15 to 25 lobes that have ducts
that empty at the nipple and that supply the nursing child with nutrient- and antibody-rich milk to aid
development and protect the child.
The pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments.
The
outermost layer of the ovary is made up of follicles that surround, nourish, and protect a single egg. During
the menstrual period, a batch of follicles develops and prepares their eggs for release. At ovulation, one follicle
ruptures and one egg is released. Following ovulation, the follicular tissue that surrounded the ovulated egg
stays within the ovary and grows to form a solid mass called the
corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes
additional estrogen and the hormone progesterone that helps maintain the uterine lining during pregnancy.
The ovaries also produce hormones, such as estrogen.
The
oviducts, or fallopian tubes, extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries,
but they are not in contact with the ovaries. The lateral ends of the oviducts are out into a trumpet-like
structure and have a fringe of nger-like projections called mbrae. When an egg is released at ovulation,
the mbrae help the nonmotile egg enter into the tube. The walls of the oviducts have a ciliated epithelium
over smooth muscle. The cilia beat, and the smooth muscle contracts, moving the egg toward the uterus.
Fertilization usually takes place within the oviduct and the developing embryo is moved toward the uterus.
It usually takes the egg or embryo a week to travel through the oviduct.
Sterilization in women is called a tubal ligation; it is analogous to a vasectomy in males in that the
oviducts are severed and sealed, preventing sperm from reaching the egg.
uterus is a structure about the size of a woman's st. The uterus has a thick muscular wall and
The
is lined with an endometrium rich in blood vessels and mucus glands that develop and thicken during the
female cycle.
Thickening of the endometrium prepares the uterus to receive the fertilized egg or zygote,
which will then implant itself in the endometrium. The uterus supports the developing embryo and fetus
during gestation. Contractions of the smooth muscle in the uterus aid in forcing the baby through the vagina
during labor.
If fertilization does not occur, a portion of the lining of the uterus sloughs o during each
menstrual period. The endometrium builds up again in preparation for implantation. Part of the uterus,
called the cervix, protrudes into the top of the vagina.
The
vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes. It allows menstrual ow to leave the body.
It is the receptacle for the penis during intercourse and the pathway for the delivery of ospring.

14.3.2 Gametogenesis (Oogenesis)
Gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, involves the process of meiosis.
During meiosis, two
nuclear divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that
were made during an earlier stage of the cell's life cycle. Meiosis and its associated cell divisions produces
haploid (n) cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid (2n) cells. The production
of sperm is called
spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis.
14.3.2.1 Oogenesis
Oogenesis occurs in the outermost layers of the ovaries. As with sperm production, oogenesis starts with a
germ cell. In oogenesis, this germ cell is called an oogonium and forms during the embryological development
of the individual. The oogonium undergoes mitosis to produce about one to two million oocytes by the time
of birth.
CHAPTER 14.
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS
its progress in the rst prophase stage. At the time of birth, all future eggs are in prophase I. This situation
is in contrast with the male reproductive system in which sperm are produced continuously throughout the
life of the individual. Starting at adolescence, anterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a few
follicles in an ovary each month. This results in a primary oocyte nishing the rst meiotic division. The cell
divides unequally, with most of the cytoplasm and organelles going to one cell, called a secondary oocyte,
and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm going to the other cell. This second cell is
called a polar body and usually dies. Cell division is again arrested, this time at metaphase II. At ovulation,
this secondary oocyte is released and travels toward the uterus through the oviduct. If the secondary oocyte
is fertilized, the cell continues through meiosis II, producing a second polar body and haploid egg, which
fuses with the haploid sperm to form a fertilized egg (zygote) containing all 46 chromosomes.
14.3.3 Hormonal Control of Reproduction
The human male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by the interaction of hormones from the
hypothalamus and anterior pituitary with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. In both sexes,
the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary gland. When the
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing
reproductive hormone is required, the hypothalamus sends a
to the anterior pituitary. This causes the release of
hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary into the blood. Although these hormones are named after their
functions in female reproduction, they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling
reproduction. Other hormones have specic functions in the male and female reproductive systems.
14.3.4 Female Hormones

The
length of 28 days.
As with the male, the GnRH from the hypothalamus causes the release of the hormones FSH and LH from
the anterior pituitary. In addition,
estrogen and relatively small amounts of progesterone are released
from the developing follicles. As with testosterone in males, estrogen is responsible for the secondary sexual
characteristics of females. These include breast development, aring of the hips, and a shorter period for
bone growth.
14.3.4.1 The Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle
The ovarian and menstrual cycles are regulated by hormones of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries
ovarian and menstrual cycles occur concurrently. The rst half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase.
Slowly rising levels of FSH cause the growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. This process prepares the
egg for ovulation. As the follicles grow, they begin releasing estrogen. The rst few days of this cycle coincide
with menstruation or the sloughing o of the functional layer of the endometrium in the uterus. After about
ve days, estrogen levels rise and the menstrual cycle enters the proliferative phase. The endometrium begins
to regrow, replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated during the end of the last cycle.
:
CHAPTER 14.
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS
The ovarian and menstrual cycles of female reproduction are regulated by hormones
produced by the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries.
Just prior to the middle of the cycle (approximately day 14), the high level of estrogen causes FSH and
especially LH to rise rapidly then fall. The spike in LH causes the most mature follicle to rupture and release
its egg. This is
ovulation. The follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost. The level
of estrogen decreases when the extra follicles degenerate.
Following ovulation, the ovarian cycle enters its luteal phase and the menstrual cycle enters its secretory
phase, both of which run from about day 15 to 28.
the ruptured follicle.
The luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in
The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a
corpus luteum. The corpus luteum produces estrogen and larger amounts of progesterone. The progesterone
facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of further FSH and LH. The uterus
is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. The inhibition of FSH and
LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated. The level of
estrogen produced by the corpus luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days.
If no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen
and progesterone decrease. The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating
the next menstrual cycle. The decrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the
anterior pituitary, releasing FSH and LH and starting the cycles again.
:
Reproductive Endocrinologist
A reproductive endocrinologist is a physician who treats a variety of hormonal disorders related to
reproduction and infertility in both men and women. The disorders include menstrual problems,
infertility, pregnancy loss, sexual dysfunction, and menopause.
Doctors may use fertility drugs,
surgery, or assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in their therapy.
ART involves the use of
procedures to manipulate the egg or sperm to facilitate reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization.
Reproductive endocrinologists undergo extensive medical training, rst in a four-year residency in
obstetrics and gynecology, then in a three-year fellowship in reproductive endocrinology.
To be
board certied in this area, the physician must pass written and oral exams in both areas.
14.3.5 Gestation
Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual. The
length of time of
gestation, or the gestation period, in humans is approximately 266 days.
Within 24 hours of fertilization, the egg nucleus has nished meiosis and the egg and sperm nuclei fuse.
With fusion, the cell is known as a zygote. The zygote initiates cleavage and the developing embryo travels
through the oviduct to the uterus. The developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within
seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. The outer layers of the developing embryo or blastocyst grow into
the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst
into the tissue. Another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing a hormone called human beta
chorionic gonadotropin (β -HCG), which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure
active. This ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for
the support of the developing embryo. Pregnancy tests determine the level of β -HCG in urine or serum. If
the hormone is present, the test is positive.
The gestation period is divided into three equal periods or trimesters. During the rst two-to-four weeks
of the rst trimester, nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diusion. As the
trimester progresses, the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium, and the placenta
forms.
The
placenta takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus, with the
mother's blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it.
Chemicals from the fetus,
such as bilirubin, are processed by the mother's liver for elimination. Some of the mother's immunoglobulins
will pass through the placenta, providing passive immunity against some potential infections.
Internal organs and body structures begin to develop during the rst trimester.
By ve weeks, limb
buds, eyes, the heart, and liver have been basically formed. By eight weeks, the term fetus applies, and the

severe eect on the fetus' survival.

active and the mother usually feels the rst movements. All organs and structures continue to develop. The
placenta has taken over the functions of nutrition and waste elimination and the production of estrogen and
progesterone from the corpus luteum, which has degenerated.
The placenta will continue functioning up
through the delivery of the baby. During the third trimester, the fetus grows to 3 to 4 kg (6.58.5 lbs.) and
This is the period of the most rapid growth during the
pregnancy as all organ systems continue to grow and develop.
Labor is the muscular contractions to expel the fetus and placenta from the uterus.
Toward the end
of the third trimester, estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the hormone
oxytocin. At this time, the baby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head
engaging the cervix (uterine opening). This causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the
hypothalamus, which signals the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin causes smooth
muscle in the uterine wall to contract. At the same time, the placenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus,
increasing the contractions.
A positive feedback relay occurs between the uterus, hypothalamus, and the
posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. As more smooth muscle cells are recruited, the
contractions increase in intensity and force.
There are three stages to labor. During stage one, the cervix thins and dilates. This is necessary for the
baby and placenta to be expelled during birth. The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm. During stage
two, the baby is expelled from the uterus. The uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses
her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery. The last stage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has
been born and the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine wall. If labor should stop before stage
two is reached, synthetic oxytocin, known as Pitocin, can be administered to restart and maintain labor.
14.3.6 Section Summary
The female reproductive cycle is controlled by hormones released from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary and hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. The hypothalamus monitors the need for FSH
and LH production and release from the anterior pituitary. FSH and LH aect reproductive structures to
cause the preparation of eggs for release and possible fertilization. In females, FSH and LH cause estrogen
and progesterone to be produced. They regulate the female reproductive cycle, which is divided into the
ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle.
Human pregnancy begins with fertilization of an egg and proceeds through the three trimesters of gestation. The rst trimester lays down the basic structures of the body, including the limb buds, heart, eyes,
and the liver. The second trimester continues the development of all of the organs and systems. The third
trimester exhibits the greatest growth of the fetus and culminates in labor and delivery.
The labor pro-
cess has three stages (contractions, delivery of the fetus, and expulsion of the placenta), each propelled by
hormones.

• List and describe the functions of bones
• Describe the classes of bones
• Discuss the process of bone formation and development
• Explain how bone repairs itself after a fracture
• Discuss the eect of exercise, nutrition, and hormones on bone tissue
Bones make good fossils. While the soft tissue of a once living organism will decay and fall away over time,
bone tissue will, under the right conditions, undergo a process of mineralization, eectively turning the bone
to stone. A well-preserved fossil skeleton can give us a good sense of the size and shape of an organism, just
as your skeleton helps to dene your size and shape. Unlike a fossil skeleton, however, your skeleton is a
structure of living tissue that grows, repairs, and renews itself. The bones within it are dynamic and complex
organs that serve a number of important functions, including some necessary to maintain homeostasis.
15.2 Functions of the Skeletal System2
Bone, or osseous tissue, is a hard, dense connective tissue that forms most of the adult skeleton, the
support structure of the body.
In the areas of the skeleton where bones move (for example, the ribcage
cartilage, a semi-rigid form of connective tissue, provides exibility and smooth surfaces for
movement. The skeletal system is the body system composed of bones and cartilage and performs the
and joints),
following critical functions for the human body:

15.2.1 Support, Movement, and Protection
The most apparent functions of the skeletal system are the gross functionsthose visible by observation.
Simply by looking at a person, you can see how the bones support, facilitate movement, and protect the
human body.
Just as the steel beams of a building provide a scaold to support its weight, the bones and cartilage of
your skeletal system compose the scaold that supports the rest of your body. Without the skeletal system,
you would be a limp mass of organs, muscle, and skin.
Bones also facilitate movement by serving as points of attachment for your muscles. While some bones
only serve as a support for the muscles, others also transmit the forces produced when your muscles contract.

15.2.2 Mineral Storage, Energy Storage, and Hematopoiesis
On a metabolic level, bone tissue performs several critical functions.
For one, the bone matrix acts as
a reservoir for a number of minerals important to the functioning of the body, especially calcium, and
potassium.
These minerals, incorporated into bone tissue, can be released back into the bloodstream to
maintain levels needed to support physiological processes.
Calcium ions, for example, are essential for
muscle contractions and controlling the ow of other ions involved in the transmission of nerve impulses.
Bone also serves as a site for fat storage and blood cell production. The softer connective tissue that

Red marrow is where hematopoiesisthe production of blood cellstakes place. Red blood cells, white
blood cells, and platelets are all produced in the red marrow.

15.3 Bone Structure3
Bone tissue (osseous tissue) diers greatly from other tissues in the body.
Bone is hard and many of its
functions depend on that characteristic hardness. Later discussions in this chapter will show that bone is
also dynamic in that its shape adjusts to accommodate stresses. This section will examine the gross anatomy
of bone rst and then move on to its histology.
15.3.1 Gross Anatomy of Bone
(Anatomy of a Long Bone )). A long bone has two parts: the
diaphysis and the epiphysis. The diaphysis
is the tubular shaft that runs between the proximal and distal ends of the bone. The hollow region in the
diaphysis is called the
medullary cavity, which is lled with yellow marrow. The walls of the diaphysis

epiphyseal plate (growth plate), a layer of hyaline
(transparent) cartilage in a growing bone. When the bone stops growing in early adulthood (approximately
1821 years), the cartilage is replaced by osseous tissue and the epiphyseal plate becomes an epiphyseal line.
15.3.2 Bone Cells and Tissue
Bone contains a relatively small number of cells entrenched in a matrix of collagen bers that provide a
surface for inorganic salt crystals to adhere. These salt crystals form when calcium phosphate and calcium
carbonate combine to create hydroxyapatite, which incorporates other inorganic salts like magnesium hydroxide, uoride, and sulfate as it crystallizes, or calcies, on the collagen bers. The hydroxyapatite crystals
give bones their hardness and strength, while the collagen bers give them exibility so that they are not
brittle.
Although bone cells compose a small amount of the bone volume, they are crucial to the function of bones.
Four types of cells are found within bone tissue: osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteogenic cells, and osteoclasts
Bone Cells
develop into osteoblasts. When osteoblasts get trapped within the calcied matrix, their structure and
function changes, and they become osteocytes. Osteoclasts develop from monocytes and macrophages
and dier in appearance from other bone cells.
CHAPTER 15.
The
SKELETAL SYSTEM
osteoblast is the bone cell responsible for forming new bone and is found in the growing portions of
bone, including the periosteum and endosteum. Osteoblasts, which do not divide, synthesize and secrete the
collagen matrix and calcium salts. As the secreted matrix surrounding the osteoblast calcies, the osteoblast
become trapped within it; as a result, it changes in structure and becomes an
of mature bone and the most common type of bone cell.
osteocyte, the primary cell
Each osteocyte is located in a space called a
lacuna and is surrounded by bone tissue. Osteocytes maintain the mineral concentration of the matrix via
the secretion of enzymes.
Like osteoblasts, osteocytes lack mitotic activity.
They can communicate with
each other and receive nutrients via long cytoplasmic processes that extend through
canaliculi (singular =
canaliculus), channels within the bone matrix.
If osteoblasts and osteocytes are incapable of mitosis, then how are they replenished when old ones die?
The answer lies in the properties of a third category of bone cellsthe
osteogenic cell. These osteogenic
cells are undierentiated with high mitotic activity and they are the only bone cells that divide. Immature
osteogenic cells are found in the deep layers of the periosteum and the marrow.
They dierentiate and
develop into osteoblasts.
The dynamic nature of bone means that new tissue is constantly formed, and old, injured, or unnecessary
bone is dissolved for repair or for calcium release. The cell responsible for bone resorption, or breakdown,
is the
osteoclast. They are found on bone surfaces, are multinucleated, and originate from monocytes and
macrophages, two types of white blood cells, not from osteogenic cells. Osteoclasts are continually breaking
down old bone while osteoblasts are continually forming new bone. The ongoing balance between osteoblasts
and osteoclasts is responsible for the constant but subtle reshaping of bone. Table 15.1 reviews the bone
cells, their functions, and locations.

15.3.3 Compact and Spongy Bone
The dierences between compact and spongy bone are best explored via their histology. Most bones contain
compact and spongy osseous tissue, but their distribution and concentration vary based on the bone's overall
function. Compact bone is dense so that it can withstand compressive forces, while spongy (cancellous) bone
has open spaces and supports shifts in weight distribution.

CHAPTER 15.
The microscopic structural unit of compact bone is called an
SKELETAL SYSTEM
osteon, or Haversian system. Each osteon
is composed of concentric rings of calcied matrix called lamellae (singular = lamella). Running down the
center of each osteon is the
central canal, or Haversian canal, which contains blood vessels, nerves, and
lymphatic vessels.
The osteocytes are located inside spaces called lacunae (singular = lacuna), found at the borders of
adjacent lamellae. As described earlier, canaliculi connect with the canaliculi of other lacunae and eventually
with the central canal. This system allows nutrients to be transported to the osteocytes and wastes to be
removed from them.
15.3.3.2 Spongy (Cancellous) Bone
Like compact bone,
spongy bone, also known as cancellous bone, contains osteocytes housed in lacunae,
but they are not arranged in concentric circles. Instead, the lacunae and osteocytes are found in a lattice-like
network of matrix spikes called

heavy compact bone by making bones lighter so that muscles can move them more easily. In addition, the
spaces in some spongy bones contain red marrow, protected by the trabeculae, where hematopoiesis occurs.

Skeletal System: Paget's Disease
Paget's disease usually occurs in adults over age 40. It is a disorder of the bone remodeling process
that begins with overactive osteoclasts. This means more bone is resorbed than is laid down. The
osteoblasts try to compensate but the new bone they lay down is weak and brittle and therefore

and curved.
What causes the osteoclasts to become overactive? The answer is still unknown, but hereditary
factors seem to play a role. Some scientists believe Paget's disease is due to an as-yet-unidentied
virus.
Paget's disease is diagnosed via imaging studies and lab tests. X-rays may show bone deformities or
areas of bone resorption. Bone scans are also useful. In these studies, a dye containing a radioactive
ion is injected into the body.
Areas of bone resorption have an anity for the ion, so they will
light up on the scan if the ions are absorbed. In addition, blood levels of an enzyme called alkaline
phosphatase are typically elevated in people with Paget's disease.
Bisphosphonates, drugs that decrease the activity of osteoclasts, are often used in the treatment
of Paget's disease. However, in a small percentage of cases, bisphosphonates themselves have been
linked to an increased risk of fractures because the old bone that is left after bisphosphonates are
administered becomes worn out and brittle. Still, most doctors feel that the benets of bisphosphonates more than outweigh the risk; the medical professional has to weigh the benets and risks on a
case-by-case basis. Bisphosphonate treatment can reduce the overall risk of deformities or fractures,
which in turn reduces the risk of surgical repair and its associated risks and complications.
15.3.4 Blood and Nerve Supply
The spongy bone and medullary cavity receive nourishment from arteries that pass through the compact
bone. The arteries enter through the
nutrient foramen (plural = foramina), small openings in the diaphysis
by blood vessels of the periosteum that penetrate spongy bone and blood that circulates in the marrow
cavities. As the blood passes through the marrow cavities, it is collected by veins, which then pass out of
the bone through the foramina.
In addition to the blood vessels, nerves follow the same paths into the bone where they tend to concentrate
in the more metabolically active regions of the bone. The nerves sense pain, and it appears the nerves also

play roles in regulating blood supplies and in bone growth, hence their concentrations in metabolically active
sites of the bone.
15.3.5 Chapter Review
A hollow medullary cavity lled with yellow marrow runs the length of the diaphysis of a long bone. The
walls of the diaphysis are compact bone. The epiphyses, which are wider sections at each end of a long bone,
are lled with spongy bone and red marrow. The epiphyseal plate, a layer of hyaline cartilage, is replaced
by osseous tissue as the organ grows in length.
Bone matrix consists of collagen bers and organic ground substance, primarily hydroxyapatite formed
from calcium salts.
Osteogenic cells develop into osteoblasts.
Osteoblasts are cells that make new bone.
They become osteocytes, the cells of mature bone, when they get trapped in the matrix. Osteoclasts engage
in bone resorption. Compact bone is dense and composed of osteons, while spongy bone is less dense and
made up of trabeculae. Blood vessels and nerves enter the bone through the nutrient foramina to nourish
and innervate bones.
15.4 Bone Formation and Development4
In the early stages of embryonic development, the embryo's skeleton consists of brous membranes and
hyaline cartilage. By the sixth or seventh week of embryonic life, the actual process of bone development,
ossication, begins.
15.4.1 Cartilage Templates
Bone is a replacement tissue; that is, it uses a model tissue on which to lay down its mineral matrix. For
skeletal development, the most common template is cartilage. During fetal development, a framework is laid
down that determines where bones will form. Unlike most connective tissues, cartilage is avascular, meaning
that it has no blood vessels supplying nutrients and removing metabolic wastes. All of these functions are
carried on by diusion through the matrix. This is why damaged cartilage does not repair itself as readily
as most tissues do.
Throughout fetal development and into childhood growth and development, bone forms on the cartilaginous matrix. By the time a fetus is born, most of the cartilage has been replaced with bone. Some additional
cartilage will be replaced throughout childhood, and some cartilage remains in the adult skeleton.
15.4.2 Endochondral Ossication
In
endochondral ossication, bone develops by replacing hyaline cartilage. Cartilage does not become
bone. Instead, cartilage serves as a template to be completely replaced by new bone.
In a long bone, for example, at about 6 to 8 weeks after conception, some of the mesenchymal cells
dierentiate into chondrocytes (cartilage cells) that form the cartilaginous skeletal precursor of the bones.
Endochondral Ossication
Endochondral ossication follows ve steps.
(a) Mesenchymal cells dierentiate into
chondrocytes. (b) The cartilage model of the future bony skeleton. (c) Capillaries penetrate cartilage.
Primary ossication center develops.
(d) Cartilage and chondrocytes continue to grow at ends of the
bone. (e) Secondary ossication centers develop. (f ) Cartilage remains at epiphyseal (growth) plate and
at joint surface as articular cartilage.
CHAPTER 15.
SKELETAL SYSTEM
As more matrix is produced, the chondrocytes in the center of the cartilaginous model grow in size. As
the matrix calcies, nutrients can no longer reach the chondrocytes.
This results in their death and the
disintegration of the surrounding cartilage. Blood vessels invade the resulting spaces, not only enlarging the
cavities but also carrying osteogenic cells with them, many of which will become osteoblasts. These enlarging
spaces eventually combine to become the medullary cavity.
As the cartilage grows, capillaries penetrate it.
This penetration initiates the transformation of the
perichondrium into the bone-producing periosteum. Here, the osteoblasts form a periosteal collar of compact
bone around the cartilage of the diaphysis. By the second or third month of fetal life, bone cell development
and ossication ramps up and creates the
primary ossication center, a region deep in the periosteal
While these deep changes are occurring, chondrocytes and cartilage continue to grow at the ends of
the bone (the future epiphyses), which increases the bone's length at the same time bone is replacing
cartilage in the diaphyses.
By the time the fetal skeleton is fully formed, cartilage only remains at the
joint surface as articular cartilage and between the diaphysis and epiphysis as the epiphyseal plate, the
latter of which is responsible for the longitudinal growth of bones. After birth, this same sequence of events
(matrix mineralization, death of chondrocytes, invasion of blood vessels from the periosteum, and seeding
with osteogenic cells that become osteoblasts) occurs in the epiphyseal regions, and each of these centers of
activity is referred to as a
15.4.3 How Bones Grow in Length
The epiphyseal plate is the area of growth in a long bone. It is a layer of hyaline cartilage where ossication
occurs in immature bones.
On the epiphyseal side of the epiphyseal plate, cartilage is formed.
On the
diaphyseal side, cartilage is ossied, and the diaphysis grows in length.
Bones continue to grow in length until early adulthood. When the chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate
cease their proliferation and bone replaces the cartilage, longitudinal growth stops. All that remains of the
epiphyseal plate is the

(b) Epiphyseal lines are the remnants of epiphyseal plates in a
mature bone.
15.4.4 How Bones Grow in Diameter
While bones are increasing in length, they are also increasing in diameter; growth in diameter can continue
even after longitudinal growth ceases. This is called appositional growth. Osteoclasts resorb old bone that
lines the medullary cavity, while osteoblasts, via intramembranous ossication, produce new bone tissue
beneath the periosteum. The erosion of old bone along the medullary cavity and the deposition of new bone
beneath the periosteum not only increase the diameter of the diaphysis but also increase the diameter of the
medullary cavity. This process is called
modeling.
15.4.5 Bone Remodeling
The process in which matrix is resorbed on one surface of a bone and deposited on another is known as bone
modeling. Modeling primarily takes place during a bone's growth. However, in adult life, bone undergoes
remodeling, in which resorption of old or damaged bone takes place on the same surface where osteoblasts
lay new bone to replace that which is resorbed.
Injury, exercise, and other activities lead to remodeling.
CHAPTER 15.
SKELETAL SYSTEM
Those inuences are discussed later in the chapter, but even without injury or exercise, about 5 to 10 percent
of the skeleton is remodeled annually just by destroying old bone and renewing it with fresh bone.

Skeletal System
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disease in which bones do not form properly and therefore
are fragile and break easily. It is also called brittle bone disease. The disease is present from birth
and aects a person throughout life.
The genetic mutation that causes OI aects the body's production of collagen, one of the critical
components of bone matrix. The severity of the disease can range from mild to severe. Those with
the most severe forms of the disease sustain many more fractures than those with a mild form.
Frequent and multiple fractures typically lead to bone deformities and short stature. Bowing of the
long bones and curvature of the spine are also common in people aicted with OI. Curvature of
the spine makes breathing dicult because the lungs are compressed.
Because collagen is such an important structural protein in many parts of the body, people with
OI may also experience fragile skin, weak muscles, loose joints, easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds,
brittle teeth, blue sclera, and hearing loss.
There is no known cure for OI. Treatment focuses
on helping the person retain as much independence as possible while minimizing fractures and
maximizing mobility. Toward that end, safe exercises, like swimming, in which the body is less likely
to experience collisions or compressive forces, are recommended. Braces to support legs, ankles,
knees, and wrists are used as needed. Canes, walkers, or wheelchairs can also help compensate for
weaknesses.
When bones do break, casts, splints, or wraps are used. In some cases, metal rods may be surgically
implanted into the long bones of the arms and legs. Research is currently being conducted on using
bisphosphonates to treat OI. Smoking and being overweight are especially risky in people with OI,
since smoking is known to weaken bones, and extra body weight puts additional stress on the bones.
15.4.6 Chapter Review
All bone formation is a replacement process. Embryos develop a cartilaginous skeleton and various membranes. During development, these are replaced by bone during the ossication process. In endochondral
ossication, bone develops by replacing hyaline cartilage. Activity in the epiphyseal plate enables bones to
grow in length.
Modeling allows bones to grow in diameter.
Remodeling occurs as bone is resorbed and
replaced by new bone. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disease in which collagen production is altered,
resulting in fragile, brittle bones.
16.1 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion1
Muscle cells are specialized for contraction. Muscles allow for motions such as walking, and they also facilitate
bodily processes such as respiration and digestion. The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal
The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and
cardiac muscle, visualized here using light microscopy.
Skeletal muscle cells are long, striated, and
multinucleate. Smooth muscle cells are short, tapered at each end, and have only one plump nucleus
in each. Cardiac muscle cells are branched and striated, but short. They also can have more than one

striations, is not under voluntary control, has only one nucleus per cell, is tapered at both ends, and is called
involuntary muscle.
Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart, and cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the
body and maintain blood pressure. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated, but unlike skeletal muscle,
cardiac muscle cannot be consciously controlled and is called involuntary muscle. Cardiac muscle cells can
have more than one nucleus per cell, are branched, and are distinguished by the presence of intercalated
disks.
16.1.1 Skeletal Muscle Fiber Structure
Each skeletal muscle ber is a skeletal muscle cell. These cells are incredibly large, with diameters of up to 100
µm and lengths of up to 30 cm. The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle ber is called the sarcolemma.
The sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction, which triggers muscle contraction. Within each
muscle ber are
myobrilslong cylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle ber. Myobrils run
the entire length of the muscle ber, and because they are only approximately 1.2 µm in diameter, hundreds
to thousands can be found inside one muscle ber. They attach to the sarcolemma at their ends, so that as
a cytoplasm called the sarcoplasm. A muscle ber is composed of many brils, packaged into orderly
units.
The striated appearance of skeletal muscle tissue is a result of repeating bands of the proteins actin and
myosin that are present along the length of myobrils. The alignment of myobrils in the cell causes the
entire cell to appear striated or banded.
The Z lines mark the border of units called
sarcomeres, which are the functional units of skeletal muscle.
A myobril is composed of many sarcomeres running along its length, and as the sarcomeres individually
in a myobril, resulting in the striation pattern characteristic of skeletal muscle.
Myobrils are composed of smaller structures called
myolaments. There are two main types of laThick laments

(composed of the protein myosin) and
Thin laments (composed of the protein actin).
The myosin thick laments contain two regions designated as the head and the tail. These regions are
important in the process of muscle contraction and will be discussed in more detail.
Two components of
the thin laments are tropomyosin and troponin. Actin has binding sites for myosin attachment. Strands
of tropomyosin block the binding sites and prevent actinmyosin interactions when the muscles are at rest.
Troponin consists of three globular subunits. One subunit binds to tropomyosin, one subunit binds to actin,
and one subunit binds Ca
2+ ions.
16.1.2 Sliding Filament Model of Contraction
For a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten. However, thick and thin lamentsthe components of sarcomeresdo not shorten. Instead, they slide by one another, causing the sarcomere to shorten
while the laments remain the same length. The sliding lament theory of muscle contraction was developed
to t the dierences observed in the named bands on the sarcomere at dierent degrees of muscle contraction
and relaxation. The mechanism of contraction is the binding of myosin to actin, forming cross-bridges that

MUSCLES AND MOVEMENT
smaller. The A band stays the same width and, at full contraction, the thin laments overlap.
When a sarcomere shortens, some regions shorten whereas others stay the same length. A sarcomere is
dened as the distance between two consecutive Z lines; when a muscle contracts, the distance between the
Z lines is reduced. Thin laments are pulled by the thick laments toward the center of the sarcomere until
the Z lines approach the thick laments. The zone of overlap, in which thin laments and thick laments
occupy the same area, increases as the thin laments move inward.
16.1.3 ATP and Muscle Contraction
The motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to actin and pull the actin inwards. This action
requires energy, which is provided by ATP. Myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the actin protein.
Myosin has another binding site for ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, releasing an
inorganic phosphate molecule and energy.
ATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and myosin to detach from each other. After
this happens, the newly bound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, Pi . The enzyme at the
binding site on myosin is called ATPase. The energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the
myosin head into a cocked position. The myosin head is then in a position for further movement, possessing
potential energy, but ADP and Pi are still attached. If actin binding sites are covered and unavailable, the
myosin will remain in the high energy conguration with ATP hydrolyzed, but still attached.
If the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will form; that is, the myosin head spans the
distance between the actin and myosin molecules. Pi is then released, allowing myosin to expend the stored
energy as a conformational change. The myosin head moves toward the M line, pulling the actin along with
it. As the actin is pulled, the laments move approximately 10 nm toward the M line. This movement is
called the power stroke, as it is the step at which force is produced. As the actin is pulled toward the M
line, the sarcomere shortens and the muscle contracts.
When the myosin head is cocked, it contains energy and is in a high-energy conguration. This energy
is expended as the myosin head moves through the power stroke; at the end of the power stroke, the myosin
head is in a low-energy position. After the power stroke, ADP is released; however, the cross-bridge formed
is still in place, and actin and myosin are bound together. ATP can then attach to myosin, which allows the

16.1.4 Regulatory Proteins
When a muscle is in a resting state, actin and myosin are separated.

without nervous input.
MUSCLES AND MOVEMENT
Troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule; it
also binds calcium ions.
To enable a muscle contraction, tropomyosin must change conformation, uncovering the myosin-binding
site on an actin molecule and allowing cross-bridge formation.
This can only happen in the presence of
calcium, which is kept at extremely low concentrations in the sarcoplasm. If present, calcium ions bind to
troponin, causing conformational changes in troponin that allow tropomyosin to move away from the myosin
binding sites on actin. Once the tropomyosin is removed, a cross-bridge can form between actin and myosin,
2+ ions and ATP are no longer available and
triggering contraction. Cross-bridge cycling continues until Ca
tropomyosin again covers the binding sites on actin.
16.1.5 ExcitationContraction Coupling
Excitationcontraction coupling is the link (transduction) between the action potential generated in the
sarcolemma and the start of a muscle contraction.
The trigger for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic
reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural signal. Each skeletal muscle ber is controlled by a motor neuron,
which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to the muscle.
muscle ber that interacts with the neuron is called the
The area of the sarcolemma on the
motor end plate.
The end of the neuron's
axon is called the synaptic terminal, and it does not actually contact the motor end plate. A small space
called the synaptic cleft separates the synaptic terminal from the motor end plate. Electrical signals travel
along the neuron's axon, which branches through the muscle and connects to individual muscle bers at a
neuromuscular junction.
The ability of cells to communicate electrically requires that the cells expend energy to create an electrical gradient across their cell membranes. This charge gradient is carried by ions, which are dierentially
distributed across the membrane. Each ion exerts an electrical inuence and a concentration inuence. Just
as milk will eventually mix with coee without the need to stir, ions also distribute themselves evenly, if
they are permitted to do so. In this case, they are not permitted to return to an evenly mixed state.
Transport proteins called sodium-potassium pumps use cellular energy (ATP) to pump two K
+ ions

inside the cell and three Na ions outside at the same time. Therefore, a concentration gradient for both ions
exists across the plasma membrane. This alone accumulates a small electrical charge, but a big concentration

So at rest, there is a large concentration gradient for Na

potential. Potential in this context means a separation of electrical charge that is capable of doing work.
It is measured in volts, just like a battery. However, the transmembrane potential is considerably smaller
(0.07 V); therefore, the small value is expressed as millivolts (mV) or 70 mV. Because the inside of a cell is

where they can then diuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to a receptor molecule on the motor end plate.

This reduces the voltage dierence between the inside and outside of the cell, which is called depolarization.
As ACh binds at the motor end plate, this depolarization is called an end-plate potential. The depolarization
then spreads along the sarcolemma, creating an action potential as sodium channels adjacent to the initial
depolarization site sense the change in voltage and open. The action potential moves across the entire cell,
creating a wave of depolarization.
ACh is broken down by the enzyme
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) into acetyl and choline. AChE resides
in the synaptic cleft, breaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh receptors, which would

step. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a specialized endoplasmic reticulum found in muscle cells that
stores calcium ions. The action potential within skeletal muscle travels down the T (Transverse) tubules
and triggers the release of calcium ions from the SR. The calcium ions bind with troponin/tropomyosin
to uncover the myosin binding sites so that contraction can occur.
After depolarization, the membrane returns to its resting state. This is called repolarization, during which
voltage-gated sodium channels close. Potassium channels continue at 90% conductance. Because the plasma
membrane sodiumpotassium ATPase always transports ions, the resting state (negatively charged inside
relative to the outside) is restored. The period immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a
nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or muscle cell regains its ability to transmit another impulse, is called the
refractory period. During the refractory period, the membrane cannot generate another action potential. .
The refractory period allows the voltage-sensitive ion channels to return to their resting congurations. The

CHAPTER 16.
MUSCLES AND MOVEMENT
16.1.6 Control of Muscle Tension
Neural control initiates the formation of actinmyosin cross-bridges, leading to the sarcomere shortening
involved in muscle contraction. These contractions extend from the muscle ber through connective tissue
to pull on bones, causing skeletal movement. The pull exerted by a muscle is called tension, and the amount
of force created by this tension can vary. This enables the same muscles to move very light objects and very
heavy objects. In individual muscle bers, the amount of tension produced depends on the cross-sectional
area of the muscle ber and the frequency of neural stimulation.
The number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin determine the amount of tension that
a muscle ber can produce. Cross-bridges can only form where thick and thin laments overlap, allowing
myosin to bind to actin. If more cross-bridges are formed, more myosin will pull on actin, and more tension
will be produced.
The ideal length of a sarcomere during production of maximal tension occurs when thick and thin
laments overlap to the greatest degree. If a sarcomere at rest is stretched past an ideal resting length, thick
and thin laments do not overlap to the greatest degree, and fewer cross-bridges can form. This results in
fewer myosin heads pulling on actin, and less tension is produced. As a sarcomere is shortened, the zone
of overlap is reduced as the thin laments reach the H zone, which is composed of myosin tails. Because
it is myosin heads that form cross-bridges, actin will not bind to myosin in this zone, reducing the tension
produced by this myober. If the sarcomere is shortened even more, thin laments begin to overlap with
each otherreducing cross-bridge formation even further, and producing even less tension. Conversely, if the
sarcomere is stretched to the point at which thick and thin laments do not overlap at all, no cross-bridges
are formed and no tension is produced. This amount of stretching does not usually occur because accessory
proteins, internal sensory nerves, and connective tissue oppose extreme stretching.
The primary variable determining force production is the number of myobers within the muscle that
receive an action potential from the neuron that controls that ber. When using the biceps to pick up a
pencil, the motor cortex of the brain only signals a few neurons of the biceps, and only a few myobers
respond. In vertebrates, each myober responds fully if stimulated. When picking up a piano, the motor
cortex signals a majority of the neurons in the biceps and most myobers participate. This is close to the
maximum force the muscle can produce. As mentioned above, increasing the frequency of action potentials
(the number of signals per second) can increase the force a bit more, because the tropomyosin is ooded
with calcium. Even at maximum voluntary contraction, not all motor units are active simultaneously; at
any given moment, some of them are at rest on a rotational basis.
16.1.7 Section Summary
The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Skeletal
muscle tissue is composed of sarcomeres, the functional units of muscle tissue. Muscle contraction occurs
when sarcomeres shorten, as thick and thin laments slide past each other, which is called the sliding
lament model of muscle contraction.
ATP provides the energy for cross-bridge formation and lament
sliding. Regulatory proteins, such as troponin and tropomyosin, control cross-bridge formation. Excitation
contraction coupling transduces the electrical signal of the neuron, via acetylcholine, to an electrical signal on
the muscle membrane, which initiates force production. The number of muscle bers contracting determines
how much force the whole muscle produces.

A neuron can be compared to an electrical wireit
transmits a signal from one place to another. Glia can be compared to the workers at the electric company
who make sure wires go to the right places, maintain the wires, and take down wires that are broken.
Although glia have been compared to workers, recent evidence suggests that also usurp some of the signaling
functions of neurons.
There is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in dierent parts of the nervous
system. There are four major types of neurons, and they share several important cellular components.
17.2.1 Neurons
The nervous system of the common laboratory y, Drosophila melanogaster, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same number as a lobster. This number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the
octopus. A human brain contains around 86 billion neurons. Despite these very dierent numbers, the nervous systems of these animals control many of the same behaviorsfrom basic reexes to more complicated
behaviors like nding food and courting mates. The ability of neurons to communicate with each other as
well as with other types of cells underlies all of these behaviors.
Most neurons share the same cellular components.
But neurons are also highly specializeddierent
types of neurons have dierent sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles.
17.2.1.1 Parts of a Neuron
Like other cells, each neuron has a cell body that contains a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components. Neurons also contain unique structures,
possible.
Dendrites are tree-like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from
synapses. Although some neurons do not have any dendrites,
other neurons at specialized junctions called
some types of neurons have multiple dendrites. Dendrites can have small protrusions called dendritic spines,
which further increase surface area for possible synaptic connections.
Once a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels passively to the cell body.

neurons, muscle, or target organs. Chemicals released at axon terminals allow signals to be communicated to
these other cells. Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like amacrine cells in the retina,
do not contain any axons. Some axons are covered with
myelin, which acts as an insulator to minimize
dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon, greatly increasing the speed on conduction.
This insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meterfrom the
base of the spine to the toes. The myelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron. Myelin is produced by
glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath. These gaps are called
Ranvier and are sites where the signal is recharged as it travels along the axon.

It is important to note that a single neuron does not act aloneneuronal communication depends on the
connections that neurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like muscle cells). Dendrites
from a single neuron may receive synaptic contact from many other neurons. For example, dendrites from a
Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive contact from as many as 200,000 other neurons.

dria. They also have more specialized structures, including dendrites and axons.
17.2.1.2 Types of Neurons
There are dierent types of neurons, and the functional role of a given neuron is intimately dependent on its
structure. There is an amazing diversity of neuron shapes and sizes found in dierent parts of the nervous
CHAPTER 17.
NERVOUS SYSTEM
Examples include (a) a pyramidal cell from the cerebral cortex, (b) a Purkinje cell from the cerebellar
cortex, and (c) olfactory cells from the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb.
Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron. Each multipolar neuron contains one axon and
multiple dendrites. Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).
An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites
but only one axon.

:
Neurogenesis
At one time, scientists believed that people were born with all the neurons they would ever
have. Research performed during the last few decades indicates that neurogenesis, the birth of new
neurons, continues into adulthood. Neurogenesis was rst discovered in songbirds that produce new
neurons while learning songs. For mammals, new neurons also play an important role in learning:
about 1000 new neurons develop in the hippocampus (a brain structure involved in learning and
memory) each day. While most of the new neurons will die, researchers found that an increase in the
number of surviving new neurons in the hippocampus correlated with how well rats learned a new
task. Interestingly, both exercise and some antidepressant medications also promote neurogenesis
in the hippocampus. Stress has the opposite eect. While neurogenesis is quite limited compared
to regeneration in other tissues, research in this area may lead to new treatments for disorders such
as Alzheimer's, stroke, and epilepsy.
How do scientists identify new neurons? A researcher can inject a compound called bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the brain of an animal. While all cells will be exposed to BrdU, BrdU will only
be incorporated into the DNA of newly generated cells that are in S phase.
A technique called
immunohistochemistry can be used to attach a uorescent label to the incorporated BrdU, and a
hippocampus of a rat.

Cells that express glial brillary acidic protein (GFAP) are labeled in green. Astrocytes, but not neurons,
express GFAP. Thus, cells that are labeled both red and green are actively dividing astrocytes, whereas
17.2.2 Glia
While glia are often thought of as the supporting cast of the nervous system, the number of glial cells in
the brain actually outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten.
Neurons would be unable to
function without the vital roles that are fullled by these glial cells. Glia guide developing neurons to their
destinations, buer ions and chemicals that would otherwise harm neurons, and provide myelin sheaths
around axons. Scientists have recently discovered that they also play a role in responding to nerve activity
and modulating communication between nerve cells. When glia do not function properly, the result can be
disastrousmost brain tumors are caused by mutations in glia.
17.2.3 Section Summary
The nervous system is made up of neurons and glia. Neurons are specialized cells that are capable of sending
electrical as well as chemical signals. Most neurons contain dendrites, which receive these signals, and axons
that send signals to other neurons or tissues.
multipolar, and pseudounipolar neurons.
There are four main types of neurons:
unipolar, bipolar,
Glia are non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that support
neuronal development and signaling. There are several types of glia that serve dierent functions.
17.3 How Neurons Communicate3
All functions performed by the nervous systemfrom a simple motor reex to more advanced functions
like making a memory or a decisionrequire neurons to communicate with one another. While humans use
words and body language to communicate, neurons use electrical and chemical signals. Just like a person
in a committee, one neuron usually receives and synthesizes messages from multiple other neurons before
making the decision to send the message on to other neurons.
17.3.1 Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron
For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals.
These signals are
possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage dierence between the inside and
the outside), and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released
from other neurons and environmental stimuli.
To understand how neurons communicate, one must rst
understand the basis of the baseline or `resting' membrane charge.
CHAPTER 17.
NERVOUS SYSTEM
17.3.1.1 Neuronal Charged Membranes
The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter
or exit the neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane.
ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell.
ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly.
These
Ion channels that
change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. Voltage-gated
ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of dierent ions inside and outside the cell. The dierence
in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the
membrane potential.
Voltage-gated ion channels open in response to changes in membrane voltage.
After
activation, they become inactivated for a brief period and will no longer open in response to a signal.
17.3.1.2 Resting Membrane Potential
A neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than
the outside (−70 mV, note that this number varies by neuron type and by species). This voltage is called the
resting membrane potential; it is caused by dierences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the
cell. If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions, each type of ion would ow across the membrane
and the system would reach equilibrium. Because ions cannot simply cross the membrane at will, there are
dierent concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell, as shown in Table 17.1. The dierence
+
in the number of positively charged potassium ions (K ) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting
+ ions accumulate inside the cell due to
a net movement with the concentration gradient. The negative resting membrane potential is created and
maintained by increasing the concentration of cations outside the cell (in the extracellular uid) relative to
inside the cell (in the cytoplasm). The negative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being
more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement. In neurons, potassium ions are
maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations
outside of the cell. The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to
diuse down their concentration gradient. However, the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels
than sodium leakage channels.
Therefore, potassium diuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than
sodium leaks in. Because more cations are leaving the cell than are entering, this causes the interior of the
cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell. The actions of the sodium potassium pump
help to maintain the resting potential, once established. Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings two
K
+ ions into the cell while removing three Na+ ions per ATP consumed. As more cations are expelled from
the cell than taken in, the inside of the cell remains negatively charged relative to the extracellular uid. It
should be noted that calcium ions (Ca
+2 ) tend to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled
by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm.

17.3.1.3 Action Potential
A neuron can receive input from other neurons and, if this input is strong enough, send the signal to
downstream neurons.
Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called
a neurotransmitter. Transmission of a signal within a neuron (from dendrite to axon terminal) is carried
by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an
action potential. When neurotransmitter
molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron's dendrites, ion channels open. At excitatory synapses, this
opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in
depolarization of the membranea decrease
in the dierence in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron. A stimulus from a sensory cell or
another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential (-55 mV). Na

considered an "all-or nothing" event, in that, once the threshold potential is reached, the neuron always

As K ions leave the cell, the membrane potential once again becomes negative. The diusion of K out of
the cell actually
hyperpolarizes the cell, in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the
cell's normal resting potential. At this point, the sodium channels will return to their resting state, meaning
they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential. Eventually
the extra K
+ ions diuse out of the cell through the potassium leakage channels, bringing the cell from its
hyperpolarized state, back to its resting membrane potential.

17.3.1.4 Myelin and the Propagation of the Action Potential
For an action potential to communicate information to another neuron, it must travel along the axon and
reach the axon terminals where it can initiate neurotransmitter release.
The speed of conduction of an
action potential along an axon is inuenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon's resistance
to ion leakage.
Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents current from leaving the axon; this increases
the speed of action potential conduction. In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, action potential
conduction slows because ions leak from previously insulated axon areas. The nodes of Ranvier, illustrated

`jumping' of the action potential from one node to the next is called
saltatory conduction. If nodes of

K
17.3.2 Synaptic Transmission
The synapse or gap is the place where information is transmitted from one neuron to another. Synapses
usually form between axon terminals and dendritic spines, but this is not universally true. There are also
axon-to-axon, dendrite-to-dendrite, and axon-to-cell body synapses.
The neuron transmitting the signal
is called the presynaptic neuron, and the neuron receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron.
Note that these designations are relative to a particular synapsemost neurons are both presynaptic and
postsynaptic. There are two types of synapses: chemical and electrical.
17.3.2.1 Chemical Synapse
When an action potential reaches the axon terminal it depolarizes the membrane and opens voltage-gated
+ channels. Na+ ions enter the cell, further depolarizing the presynaptic membrane. This depolarization

2+ channels to open. Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that
causes small membrane-bound vesicles, called
synaptic vesicles, containing neurotransmitter molecules to

cell. The calcium entry causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane and release neurotransmitter
molecules into the synaptic cleft.
The neurotransmitter diuses across the synaptic cleft and binds
to ligand-gated ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane, resulting in a localized depolarization or
hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron.
CHAPTER 17.
NERVOUS SYSTEM
The binding of a specic neurotransmitter causes particular ion channels, in this case chemically-gated
channels, on the postsynaptic membrane to open. Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or inhibitory
eects on the postsynaptic membrane, as detailed in Table 17.1. For example, when acetylcholine is released
at the synapse between a nerve and muscle (called the neuromuscular junction) by a presynaptic neuron, it
causes postsynaptic Na
+ channels to open. Na+ enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic
membrane to depolarize. This depolarization is called an
excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)
and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to re an action potential. Release of neurotransmitter at
inhibitory synapses causes
inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), a hyperpolarization of the presy-
naptic membrane. For example, when the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released
-
-
from a presynaptic neuron, it binds to and opens Cl channels. Cl ions enter the cell and hyperpolarizes the
membrane, making the neuron less likely to re an action potential.
Once neurotransmission has occurred, the neurotransmitter must be removed from the synaptic cleft so
the postsynaptic membrane can reset and be ready to receive another signal. This can be accomplished in
three ways: the neurotransmitter can diuse away from the synaptic cleft, it can be degraded by enzymes
in the synaptic cleft, or it can be recycled (sometimes called reuptake) by the presynaptic neuron. Several
drugs act at this step of neurotransmission. For example, some drugs that are given to Alzheimer's patients
work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine.
This inhibition of the
enzyme essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release acetylcholine.
Once released, the
acetylcholine stays in the cleft and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors.

17.3.3 Signal Summation
Sometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, but
often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to
be suciently depolarized to re an action potential. This process is called
summation and occurs at the
neuronssome excitatory and some inhibitoryso IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa. It is the
net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its
threshold of excitation needed to re an action potential. Together, synaptic summation and the threshold
for excitation act as a lter so that random noise in the system is not transmitted as important information.
resulting in local membrane depolarization (EPSP input) and hyperpolarization (IPSP input). All these
inputs are added together at the axon hillock. If the EPSPs are strong enough to overcome the IPSPs
and reach the threshold of excitation, the neuron will re.
17.3.4 Section Summary
Neurons have charged membranes because there are dierent concentrations of ions inside and outside of the
cell. Voltage-gated ion channels control the movement of ions into and out of a neuron. When a neuronal
membrane is depolarized to at least the threshold of excitation, an action potential is red.
The action
potential is then propagated along an axon to the axon terminals. In a chemical synapse, the action potential causes release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft. Through binding to postsynaptic
receptors, the neurotransmitter can cause excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials by depolarizing
or hyperpolarizing, respectively, the postsynaptic membrane.
17.4 The Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems4
17.4.1 The Central Nervous System
The
central nervous system (CNS) is made up of the brain and spinal cord and is covered with three layers
meninges (meninges is derived from the Greek and means membranes)
of protective coverings called
and the inner layer is the pia mater, which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord. The space
between the arachnoid and pia maters is lled with
cerebrospinal uid (CSF). The brain oats in CSF,
which acts as a cushion and shock absorber.
17.4.2 The Brain
The brain is the part of the central nervous system that is contained in the cranial cavity of the skull. It
includes the cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, brainstem,
cerebral
cortex. The cerebral cortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia make up the two cerebral hemispheres. A
thick ber bundle called the corpus callosum (corpus = body; callosum = tough) connects the two
and retinas. The outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the
hemispheres. Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the
other, the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant. In fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire
hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy. While patients do suer some decits following the surgery,
they can have surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is performed on children who have very
immature nervous systems.
In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire
hemisphere. This causes a condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two
hemispheres. For example, when an object is presented to patients' left visual eld, they may be unable to
verbally name the object (and may claim to not have seen an object at all). This is because the visual input
from the left visual eld crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then signal to the speech center,
which generally is found in the left side of the brain. Remarkably, if a split-brain patient is asked to pick up
CHAPTER 17.
NERVOUS SYSTEM
a specic object out of a group of objects with the left hand, the patient will be able to do so but will still
be unable to verbally identify it.
Each hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in dierent functions. Each hemisphere
of the mammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially dened lobes:
The
frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain, over the eyes. This lobe contains the olfactory bulb,
which processes smells. The frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex, which is important for planning and
implementing movement. Areas within the motor cortex map to dierent muscle groups. Neurons in the
frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining attention, speech, and decision-making. Studies
of humans who have damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are involved in personality,
socialization, and assessing risk.
The
parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain. Neurons in the
parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading. Two of the parietal lobe's main functions are processing
somatosensationtouch sensations like pressure, pain, heat, coldand processing proprioceptionthe sense
of how parts of the body are oriented in space. The parietal lobe contains a somatosensory map of the body
similar to the motor cortex.
The
occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain. It is primarily
The temporal lobe is located
involved in visionseeing, recognizing, and identifying the visual world.
at the base of the brain and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds. It also contains
the
hippocampus (named from the Greek for seahorse, which it resembles in shape) a structure that
processes memory formation. The role of the hippocampus in memory was partially determined by studying
one famous epileptic patient, HM, who had both sides of his hippocampus removed in an attempt to cure his
epilepsy. His seizures went away, but he could no longer form new memories (although he could remember
some facts from before his surgery and could learn new motor tasks).
Interconnected brain areas called the
basal ganglia play important roles in movement control and
posture. The basal ganglia also regulate motivation.
The
thalamus acts as a gateway to and from the cortex. Sensory and motor impulses go through it
from the brain to the eectors in the peripheral nervous system. It also receives feedback from the cortex.
This feedback mechanism can modulate conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the
attention and arousal state of the animal.

Below the thalamus is the

hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending
signals to the pituitary gland. Among other functions, the hypothalamus is the body's thermostatit makes
sure the body temperature is kept at appropriate levels.
Neurons within the hypothalamus also regulate
circadian rhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles.
The
limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related
to fear and motivation. It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus. One important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe
structure called the
amygdala. The two amygdala (one on each side) are important both for the sensation
of fear and for recognizing fearful faces.
The
cerebellum (cerebellum = little brain) sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem.
The cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks.
The
cerebellum of birds is large compared to other vertebrates because of the coordination required by ight.
The
brainstem connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord and regulates some of the most
important and basic functions of the nervous system including breathing, swallowing, digestion, sleeping,
walking, and sensory and motor information integration.
17.4.3 Spinal cord
Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord.
The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and
from the brain to the body. The spinal cord is contained within the meninges and the bones of the vertebral
column but is able to communicate signals to and from the body through its connections with spinal nerves
(part of the peripheral nervous system). A cross-section of the spinal cord looks like a white oval containing
cell bodies (and interneurons) make up the gray matter. Axons and cell bodies in the dorsal spinal cord
convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain. Axons and cell bodies in the ventral spinal
cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the body.
The spinal cord also controls motor reexes.
These reexes are quick, unconscious movementslike
automatically removing a hand from a hot object. Reexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic
connections. For example, the knee reex that a doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single
synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron. While a reex may only require the involvement of
one or two synapses, synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit information to the brain to
convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was hot).

peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the connection between the central nervous system and the
autonomic nervous system, which controls bodily
functions without conscious control, and the sensory-somatic nervous system, which transmits sensory
The
rest of the body. The PNS can be broken down into the
information from the skin, muscles, and sensory organs to the CNS and sends motor commands from the
CNS to the muscles.
In the autonomic nervous system, a preganglionic neuron (originating in the thoraco-
lumbar region of the spinal cord) synapses to a neuron in a ganglion that, in turn, synapses on a target
organ. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system causes release of norepinephrine on the target organ. Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system causes release of acetylcholine on the target organ.
CHAPTER 17.
NERVOUS SYSTEM
The autonomic nervous system serves as the relay between the CNS and the internal organs. It controls
the lungs, the heart, smooth muscle, and exocrine and endocrine glands and vicera of the abdominal cavity.
The autonomic nervous system controls these organs largely without conscious control; it can continuously
monitor the conditions of these dierent systems and implement changes as needed. Signaling to the target
tissue usually involves two synapses: a preganglionic neuron (originating in the CNS) synapses to a neuron in
nervous system that often have opposing eects: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic
nervous system.
The
sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the immediate responses an animal makes when
it encounters a dangerous situation. One way to remember this is to think of the ght-or-ight response
a person feels when encountering a snake (snake and sympathetic both begin with s).
Examples of
functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system include an accelerated heart rate and inhibited
digestion.
These functions help prepare an organism's body for the physical strain required to escape a
potentially dangerous situation or to fend o a predator.
target organs.
While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations, the parasympathetic nervous
system allows an animal to rest and digest. One way to remember this is to think that during a restful
situation like a picnic, the parasympathetic nervous system is in control (picnic and parasympathetic
both start with p). Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and
organ function after the sympathetic nervous system is activated including slowing of heart rate, lowered
blood pressure, and stimulation of digestion.
The sensory-somatic nervous system is made up of cranial and spinal nerves and contains both sensory

NERVOUS SYSTEM
and motor neurons. Sensory neurons transmit sensory information from the skin, skeletal muscle, and sensory
organs to the CNS. Motor neurons transmit messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles
to make them contract. Without its sensory-somatic nervous system, an animal would be unable to process
any information about its environment (what it sees, feels, hears, and so on) and could not control motor
movements. Unlike the autonomic nervous system, which usually has two synapses between the CNS and
the target organ, sensory and motor neurons usually have only one synapseone ending of the neuron is at
the organ and the other directly contacts a CNS neuron.
17.4.5 Section Summary
The vertebrate central nervous system contains the brain and the spinal cord, which are covered and protected
by three meninges.
The brain contains structurally and functionally dened regions.
In mammals, these
include the cortex (which can be broken down into four primary functional lobes: frontal, temporal, occipital,
and parietal), basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, limbic system, cerebellum, and brainstemalthough
structures in some of these designations overlap. While functions may be primarily localized to one structure
in the brain, most complex functions, like language and sleep, involve neurons in multiple brain regions. The
spinal cord is the information superhighway that connects the brain with the rest of the body through its
connections with peripheral nerves. It transmits sensory input and motor output and also controls motor
reexes.
The peripheral nervous system contains both the autonomic and sensory-somatic nervous systems. The
autonomic nervous system provides unconscious control over visceral functions and has two divisions: the
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful
situations to prepare the animal for a ght-or-ight response. The parasympathetic nervous system is active
during restful periods. The sensory-somatic nervous system is made of cranial and spinal nerves that transmit
sensory information from skin and muscle to the CNS and motor commands from the CNS to the muscles.

information about the organism's internal environment. All bilaterally symmetric animals have a sensory

environment. While it is helpful to this underwater predator, electrosensitivity is a sense not found in most
land animals. in this chapter, information about smell, taste, hearing, and vision is presented.
18.2 Taste and Smell2
Taste, also called
gustation, and smell, also called olfaction, are the most interconnected senses in that
both involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors. Smell lets an animal
sense the presence of food other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival. Similarly, the
sense of taste allows animals to discriminate between types of foods. While the value of a sense of smell is
obvious, what is the value of a sense of taste? Dierent tasting foods have dierent attributes, both helpful
and harmful. For example, sweet-tasting substances tend to be highly caloric, which could be necessary for
survival in lean times. Bitterness is associated with toxicity, and sourness is associated with spoiled food.
Salty foods are valuable in maintaining homeostasis by helping the body retain water and by providing ions

The primary tastes detected
The rst four tastes need little explanation.
The
umami as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recentlyit was identied in 1908 by Japanese
scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth, but it was not widely accepted as a taste that
could be physiologically distinguished until many years later. The taste of umami, also known as savoriness,
is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L-glutamate. In fact, monosodium glutamate, or MSG, is often
used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods. What is the adaptive value of being able to
distinguish umami? Savory substances tend to be high in protein.
All odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe. If a substance does not release molecules
into the air from its surface, it has no smell. And if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that
recognizes a specic molecule, then that molecule has no smell. Humans have about 350 olfactory receptor
subtypes that work in various combinations to allow us to sense about 10,000 dierent odors. Compare that
to mice, for example, which have about 1,300 olfactory receptor types, and therefore probably sense more
odors. Both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specic chemoreceptors. Although humans
commonly distinguish taste as one sense and smell as another, they work together to create the perception
of avor. A person's perception of avor is reduced if he or she has congested nasal passages.

2 in humans. Recall that
olfactory receptor, which is a dendrite of a specialized neuron, responds when
it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by sending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb
of the brain.
Humans have about 12 million olfactory receptors, distributed among hundreds of dierent
receptor types that respond to dierent odors.
Twelve million seems like a large number of receptors,
but compare that to other animals: rabbits have about 100 million, most dogs have about 1 billion, and
bloodhoundsdogs selectively bred for their sense of smellhave about 4 billion. The overall size of the
olfactory epithelium also diers between species, with that of bloodhounds, for example, being many times
larger than that of humans.
Olfactory neurons are
bipolar neurons (neurons with two processes from the cell body). Each neuron
has a single dendrite buried in the olfactory epithelium, and extending from this dendrite are 5 to 20 receptorladen, hair-like cilia that trap odorant molecules. The sensory receptors on the cilia are proteins, and it is the
variations in their amino acid chains that make the receptors sensitive to dierent odorants. Each olfactory
sensory neuron has only one type of receptor on its cilia, and the receptors are specialized to detect specic
odorants, so the bipolar neurons themselves are specialized. When an odorant binds with a receptor that
recognizes it, the sensory neuron associated with the receptor is stimulated. Olfactory stimulation is the only
sensory information that directly reaches the cerebral cortex, whereas other sensations are relayed through
the thalamus.

Pheromones
A pheromone is a chemical released by an animal that aects the behavior or physiology of animals
:
of the same species. Pheromonal signals can have profound eects on animals that inhale them, but
pheromones apparently are not consciously perceived in the same way as other odors. There are
several dierent types of pheromones, which are released in urine or as glandular secretions. Certain pheromones are attractants to potential mates, others are repellants to potential competitors
of the same sex, and still others play roles in mother-infant attachment. Some pheromones can also

become less important in human behavior over evolutionary time compared to their importance to
organisms with more limited behavioral repertoires.
The vomeronasal organ (VNO, or Jacobson's organ) is a tubular, uid-lled, olfactory organ present
in many vertebrate animals that sits adjacent to the nasal cavity. It is very sensitive to pheromones
and is connected to the nasal cavity by a duct.
When molecules dissolve in the mucosa of the
nasal cavity, they then enter the VNO where the pheromone molecules among them bind with
specialized pheromone receptors. Upon exposure to pheromones from their own species or others,
of the upper lip that helps pheromone molecules enter the VNO.
Pheromonal signals are sent, not to the main olfactory bulb, but to a dierent neural structure that
projects directly to the amygdala (recall that the amygdala is a brain center important in emotional
reactions, such as fear). The pheromonal signal then continues to areas of the hypothalamus that
are key to reproductive physiology and behavior.
While some scientists assert that the VNO is
apparently functionally vestigial in humans, even though there is a similar structure located near
human nasal cavities, others are researching it as a possible functional system that may, for example,
contribute to synchronization of menstrual cycles in women living in close proximity.
18.2.2.1 Taste
Detecting a taste (gustation) is fairly similar to detecting an odor (olfaction), given that both taste and
smell rely on chemical receptors being stimulated by certain molecules. The primary organ of taste is the
taste bud. A
taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors (taste cells) that are located within the bumps
on the tongue called
distinct papillae. Filiform papillae, which are located across the tongue, are tactile, providing friction that
helps the tongue move substances, and contain no taste cells.
In contrast, fungiform papillae, which are
located mainly on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, each contain one to eight taste buds and also have
receptors for pressure and temperature. The large circumvallate papillae contain up to 100 taste buds and
form a V near the posterior margin of the tongue.
In addition to those two types of chemically and mechanically sensitive papillae are foliate papillae
leaf-like papillae located in parallel folds along the edges and toward the back of the tongue, as seen in the
circumvallate papillae, which are wall-like papillae in the shape of an inverted V at the back of the tongue.
Each of these papillae is surrounded by a groove and contains about 250 taste buds.
Each taste bud's taste cells are replaced every 10 to 14 days. These are elongated cells with hair-like
molecules (
tastants) are dissolved in saliva, and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli.
The receptors for tastants are located across the outer portion and front of the tongue, outside of the middle
area where the liform papillae are most prominent.
CHAPTER 18.
SPECIAL SENSES
of work by Vincenzo Rizzo)
In humans, there are ve primary tastes, and each taste has only one corresponding type of receptor.
Thus, like olfaction, each receptor is specic to its stimulus (tastant).
Transduction of the ve tastes
happens through dierent mechanisms that reect the molecular composition of the tastant. A salty tastant
+
(containing NaCl) provides the sodium ions (Na ) that enter the taste neurons and excite them directly. Sour
tastants are acids and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family. Binding of an acid or other sour-tasting
+
molecule triggers a change in the ion channel and these increase hydrogen ion (H ) concentrations in the taste
neurons, thus depolarizing them. Sweet, bitter, and umami tastants require a G-protein coupled receptor.
These tastants bind to their respective receptors, thereby exciting the specialized neurons associated with
them.
Both tasting abilities and sense of smell change with age. In humans, the senses decline dramatically by
age 50 and continue to decline. A child may nd a food to be too spicy, whereas an elderly person may nd
the same food to be bland and unappetizing.
18.2.3 Section Summary
There are ve primary tastes in humans: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.
Each taste has its own
receptor type that responds only to that taste. Tastants enter the body and are dissolved in saliva. Taste
cells are located within taste buds, which are found on three of the four types of papillae in the mouth.
Regarding olfaction, there are many thousands of odorants, but humans detect only about 10,000. Like
taste receptors, olfactory receptors are each responsive to only one odorant.
Odorants dissolve in nasal
mucosa, where they excite their corresponding olfactory sensory cells. When these cells detect an odorant,
they send their signals to other structures which ultimately are conveyed to the CNS.
18.3 Hearing and Vestibular Sensation3
Audition, or hearing, is important to humans and to other animals for many dierent interactions. It
enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger, such as an approaching predator,
and to participate in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating. On the other hand,
although it is physically linked to the auditory system, the vestibular system is not involved in hearing.
Instead, an animal's vestibular system detects its own movement, both linear and angular acceleration and
deceleration, and balance.
18.3.1 Sound
Auditory stimuli are sound waves, which are mechanical, pressure waves that move through a medium, such
as air or water. There are no sound waves in a vacuum since there are no air molecules to move in waves. The
speed of sound waves diers, based on altitude, temperature, and medium, but at sea level and a temperature
of 20º C (68º F), sound waves travel in the air at about 343 meters per second.
As is true for all waves, there are four main characteristics of a sound wave: frequency, wavelength, period,
and amplitude. Frequency is the number of waves per unit of time, and in sound is heard as pitch. Highfrequency (≥15.000Hz) sounds are higher-pitched (short wavelength) than low-frequency (long wavelengths;
≤100Hz) sounds. Frequency is measured in cycles per second, and for sound, the most commonly used unit is
hertz (Hz), or cycles per second. Most humans can perceive sounds with frequencies between 30 and 20,000
Hz. Women are typically better at hearing high frequencies, but everyone's ability to hear high frequencies
decreases with age. Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz; cats, 60,000 Hz; bats, 100,000 Hz; and dolphins
150,000 Hz, and American shad (Alosa sapidissima), a sh, can hear 180,000 Hz. Those frequencies above
the human range are called
ultrasound.
Amplitude, or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough, in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated

In mammals, sound waves are collected by the external, cartilaginous part of the ear called the
travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the
middle ear. The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles, which transfer energy from the
moving tympanum to the inner ear. The three ossicles are the malleus (also known as the hammer), the
incus (the anvil), and stapes (the stirrup). The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup. The
drum, the innermost part of the
three ossicles are unique to mammals, and each plays a role in hearing. The malleus attaches at three points
to the interior surface of the tympanic membrane. The incus attaches the malleus to the stapes. In humans,
the stapes is not long enough to reach the tympanum. If we did not have the malleus and the incus, then
the vibrations of the tympanum would never reach the inner ear. These bones also function to collect force
and amplify sounds. The ear ossicles are homologous to bones in a sh mouth: the bones that support gills
in sh are thought to be adapted for use in the vertebrate ear over evolutionary time. Many animals (frogs,
reptiles, and birds, for example) use the stapes of the middle ear to transmit vibrations to the middle ear.

18.3.3 Transduction of Sound
Vibrating objects, such as vocal cords, create sound waves or pressure waves in the air. When these pressure
waves reach the ear, the ear transduces this mechanical stimulus (pressure wave) into a nerve impulse
(electrical signal) that the brain perceives as sound. The pressure waves strike the tympanum, causing it to
vibrate. The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of
oval window, which

is the outermost structure of the
bony, hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear. Here, the energy from the sound wave is
transferred from the stapes through the exible oval window and to the uid of the cochlea. The vibrations of
the oval window create pressure waves in the uid (perilymph) inside the cochlea. The
cochlea is a whorled
structure, like the shell of a snail, and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an
basilar membrane is a mechanical
analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea, curling toward the cochlea's center.
The mechanical properties of the basilar membrane change along its length, such that it is thicker, tauter,
and narrower at the outside of the whorl (where the cochlea is largest), and thinner, oppier, and broader
toward the apex, or center, of the whorl (where the cochlea is smallest).
Dierent regions of the basilar
membrane vibrate according to the frequency of the sound wave conducted through the uid in the cochlea.
For these reasons, the uid-lled cochlea detects dierent wave frequencies (pitches) at dierent regions of
the membrane. When the sound waves in the cochlear uid contact the basilar membrane, it exes back and
forth in a wave-like fashion. Above the basilar membrane is the
tectorial membrane.
:
In the human ear, sound waves cause the stapes to press against the oval window.
Vibrations travel up the uid-lled interior of the cochlea. The basilar membrane that lines the cochlea
gets continuously thinner toward the apex of the cochlea. Dierent thicknesses of membrane vibrate in
response to dierent frequencies of sound.
Sound waves then exit through the round window.
In the
cross section of the cochlea (top right gure), note that in addition to the upper canal and lower canal,
the cochlea also has a middle canal. The organ of Corti (bottom image) is the site of sound transduction.
Movement of stereocilia on hair cells results in an action potential that travels along the auditory nerve.
The site of transduction is in the
organ of Corti (spiral organ).
It is composed of hair cells held in
place above the basilar membrane like owers projecting up from soil, with their exposed short, hair-like
stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them. The inner hair cells are the
primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row, numbering approximately 3,500. The stereocilia from
inner hair cells extend into small dimples on the tectorial membrane's lower surface. The outer hair cells are
arranged in three or four rows. They number approximately 12,000, and they function to ne tune incoming
sound waves. The longer stereocilia that project from the outer hair cells actually attach to the tectorial
membrane. All of the stereocilia are mechanoreceptors, and when bent by vibrations they respond by opening
a gated ion channel. As a result, the hair cell membrane is depolarized, and a signal is transmitted to the
chochlear nerve. Intensity (volume) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location
CHAPTER 18.
SPECIAL SENSES
are stimulated.
The hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way. The basilar membrane vibrates
in dierent regions, according to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it. Likewise, the hair cells
that lay above it are most sensitive to a specic frequency of sound waves. Hair cells can respond to a small
range of similar frequencies, but they require stimulation of greater intensity to re at frequencies outside
of their optimal range. The dierence in response frequency between adjacent inner hair cells is about 0.2
percent. Compare that to adjacent piano strings, which are about six percent dierent. Place theory, which
is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear, states that high frequency
sounds selectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port (the oval window).
Lower frequencies travel farther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane.
The basic pitch-determining mechanism is based on the location along the membrane where the hair cells
are stimulated. The place theory is the rst step toward an understanding of pitch perception. Considering
the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear, it is thought that there must be some auditory sharpening
mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution.
When sound waves produce uid waves inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane exes, bending the
stereocilia that attach to the tectorial membrane. Their bending results in action potentials in the hair cells,
and auditory information travels along the neural endings of the bipolar neurons of the hair cells (collectively,
the auditory nerve) to the brain. When the hairs bend, they release an excitatory neurotransmitter at a
synapse with a sensory neuron, which then conducts action potentials to the central nervous system. The
cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve sends information on hearing. The auditory system
is very rened, and there is some modulation or sharpening built in. The brain can send signals back to
the cochlea, resulting in a change of length in the outer hair cells, sharpening or dampening the hair cells'
response to certain frequencies.

through the ear structure, stimulating cochlear nerve impulses, and eventually sending signals to
the temporal lobe.
18.3.3.1 Higher Processing
The inner hair cells are most important for conveying auditory information to the brain. About 90 percent
of the aerent neurons carry information from inner hair cells, with each hair cell synapsing with 10 or
so neurons. Outer hair cells connect to only 10 percent of the aerent neurons, and each aerent neuron
innervates many hair cells.
The aerent, bipolar neurons that convey auditory information travel from
the cochlea to the medulla, through the pons and midbrain in the brainstem, nally reaching the primary
auditory cortex in the temporal lobe.
18.3.4 Vestibular Information
The stimuli associated with the vestibular system are linear acceleration (gravity) and angular acceleration
and deceleration.
Gravity, acceleration, and deceleration are detected by evaluating the inertia on recep-
tive cells in the vestibular system.
Gravity is detected through head position.
Angular acceleration and
deceleration are expressed through turning or tilting of the head.
The vestibular system has some similarities with the auditory system. It utilizes hair cells just like the
auditory system, but it excites them in dierent ways. There are ve vestibular receptor organs in the inner
ear: the utricle, the saccule, and three semicircular canals. Together, they make up what's known as the
line, such as gravity. The roughly 30,000 hair cells in the utricle and 16,000 hair cells in the saccule lie below
a gelatinous layer, with their stereocilia projecting into the gelatin. Embedded in this gelatin are calcium
carbonate crystalslike tiny rocks.
When the head is tilted, the crystals continue to be pulled straight
down by gravity, but the new angle of the head causes the gelatin to shift, thereby bending the stereocilia.
The bending of the stereocilia stimulates the neurons, and they signal to the brain that the head is tilted,
allowing the maintenance of balance. It is the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve that
deals with balance.
The uid-lled
semicircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles. They are arranged in three
spatial planes. The base of each canal has a swelling that contains a cluster of hair cells. The hairs project
into a gelatinous cap called the cupula and monitor angular acceleration and deceleration from rotation.
They would be stimulated by driving your car around a corner, turning your head, or falling forward. One
canal lies horizontally, while the other two lie at about 45 degree angles to the horizontal axis, as illustrated in
or deceleration in three dimensions. When the head turns, the uid in the canals shifts, thereby bending
stereocilia and sending signals to the brain. Upon cessation accelerating or deceleratingor just moving
the movement of the uid within the canals slows or stops. For example, imagine holding a glass of water.
When moving forward, water may splash backwards onto the hand, and when motion has stopped, water
may splash forward onto the ngers. While in motion, the water settles in the glass and does not splash.
CHAPTER 18.
SPECIAL SENSES
Note that the canals are not sensitive to velocity itself, but to changes in velocity, so moving forward at
60mph with your eyes closed would not give the sensation of movement, but suddenly accelerating or braking
would stimulate the receptors.
18.3.4.1 Higher Processing
Hair cells from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals also communicate through bipolar neurons to
the cochlear nucleus in the medulla. Cochlear neurons send descending projections to the spinal cord and
ascending projections to the pons, thalamus, and cerebellum. Connections to the cerebellum are important
for coordinated movements. There are also projections to the temporal cortex, which account for feelings
of dizziness; projections to autonomic nervous system areas in the brainstem, which account for motion
sickness; and projections to the primary somatosensory cortex, which monitors subjective measurements
of the external world and self-movement. People with lesions in the vestibular area of the somatosensory
cortex see vertical objects in the world as being tilted. Finally, the vestibular signals project to certain optic
muscles to coordinate eye and head movements.

18.3.5 Section Summary
Audition is important for territory defense, predation, predator defense, and communal exchanges.
The
vestibular system, which is not auditory, detects linear acceleration and angular acceleration and deceleration.
Both the auditory system and vestibular system use hair cells as their receptors.
Auditory stimuli are sound waves. The sound wave energy reaches the outer ear (pinna, canal, tympanum), and vibrations of the tympanum send the energy to the middle ear. The middle ear bones shift and
the stapes transfers mechanical energy to the oval window of the uid-lled inner ear cochlea. Once in the
cochlea, the energy causes the basilar membrane to ex, thereby bending the stereocilia on receptor hair
cells. This activates the receptors, which send their auditory neural signals to the brain.
The vestibular system has ve parts that work together to provide the sense of direction, thus helping to
maintain balance. The utricle and saccule measure head orientation: their calcium carbonate crystals shift
when the head is tilted, thereby activating hair cells. The semicircular canals work similarly, such that when
the head is turned, the uid in the canals bends stereocilia on hair cells. The vestibular hair cells also send
signals to the thalamus and to somatosensory cortex, but also to the cerebellum, the structure above the
brainstem that plays a large role in timing and coordination of movement.

then sent to the auditory nerve. Which of the following types of hearing loss would not be restored
by a cochlear implant?
a. Hearing loss resulting from absence or loss of hair cells in the organ of Corti.
b. Hearing loss resulting from an abnormal auditory nerve.
c. Hearing loss resulting from fracture of the cochlea.
d. Hearing loss resulting from damage to bones of the middle ear.
18.4 Vision6
Vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images.
Humans are bombarded with sensory information, and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic. Fortunately, our visual system is able to attend to the most-important stimuli. The importance of
vision to humans is further substantiated by the fact that about one-third of the human cerebral cortex is
dedicated to analyzing and perceiving visual information.
18.4.1 Light
As with auditory stimuli, light travels in waves. The compression waves that compose sound must travel in
a mediuma gas, a liquid, or a solid. In contrast, light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs
of the behavior of waves and also in terms of the behavior of the fundamental unit of lighta packet of
electromagnetic radiation called a photon. A glance at the electromagnetic spectrum shows that visible light
for humans is just a small slice of the entire spectrum, which includes radiation that we cannot see as light
because it is below the frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible violet light.
Certain variables are important when discussing perception of light. Wavelength (which varies inversely
with frequency) manifests itself as hue. Light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths
(and is lower frequency), while light at the violet end has shorter wavelengths (and is higher frequency). The
wavelength of light is expressed in nanometers (nm); one nanometer is one billionth of a meter. Humans
perceive light that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740 nm. Some other animals, though, can
detect wavelengths outside of the human range. For example, bees see near-ultraviolet light in order to locate
nectar guides on owers, and some non-avian reptiles sense infrared light (heat that prey gives o ).

Light waves travel 299,792 km per second in a vacuum, (and somewhat slower in various media such as
air and water), and those waves arrive at the eye as long (red), medium (green), and short (blue) waves.
What is termed white light is light that is perceived as white by the human eye. This eect is produced
by light that stimulates equally the color receptors in the human eye. The apparent color of an object is the
color (or colors) that the object reects. Thus a red object reects the red wavelengths in mixed (white)
light and absorbs all other wavelengths of light.

The
cornea, the front transparent layer of the eye, and the crystalline lens, a
transparent convex structure behind the cornea, both refract (bend) light to focus the image on the retina.
The
iris, which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye, is a circular muscular ring lying between the
lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye. In conditions of high ambient light, the
iris contracts, reducing the size of the pupil at its center. In conditions of low light, the iris relaxes and the
pupil enlarges.
:
The main function of the lens is to focus light on the retina and fovea centralis. The lens is dynamic, focusing
and re-focusing light as the eye rests on near and far objects in the visual eld. The lens is operated by
muscles that stretch it at or allow it to thicken, changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus
it sharply on the retina. With age comes the loss of the exibility of the lens, and a form of farsightedness
presbyopia results. Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina. Presbyopia is a
hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short.
For both defects, images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry. Myopia (nearsightedness)

The
fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision. The fovea has
a high density of just cones. When you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light,
the eyes orient so that the object's image falls on the fovea.
This is the area of the retina that gives us
high clarity of vision. However, when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim light, the
object can be better viewed by the peripheral vision because it is the rods in higher concentrations in the
other regions of the retina, rather than the cones at the center, that operate better in low light. In low-light
conditions, the rods allow us to see in shades of gray because cones require bright light to be stimulated and
don't respond in low light conditions.

There are three types of cones (with dierent photopsins), and they dier in the wavelength to which they
of 420 nm, so they are called S cones (S for short); others respond maximally to waves of 530 nm (M
cones, for medium); a third group responds maximally to light of longer wavelengths, at 560 nm (L, or
long cones). With only one type of cone, color vision would not be possible, and a two-cone (dichromatic)
system has limitations. Primates use a three-cone (trichromatic) system, resulting in full color vision.
The color we perceive is a result of the ratio of activity of our three types of cones. The colors of the
visual spectrum, running from long-wavelength light to short, are red (700 nm), orange (600 nm), yellow
(565 nm), green (497 nm), blue (470 nm), indigo (450 nm), and violet (425 nm). Humans have very sensitive
perception of color and can distinguish about 500 levels of brightness, 200 dierent hues, and 20 steps of
saturation, or about 2 million distinct colors.
CHAPTER 18.
SPECIAL SENSES
However, there is considerable overlap in the wavelengths of light detected.
18.4.3.2 Retinal Processing
Visual signals leave the cones and rods, travel to the bipolar cells, and then to ganglion cells. A large degree
of processing of visual information occurs in the retina itself, before visual information is sent to the brain.
18.4.4 Higher Processing
The myelinated axons of ganglion cells make up the optic nerves. Within the nerves, dierent axons carry
dierent qualities of the visual signal. Some axons constitute the magnocellular (big cell) pathway, which
carries information about form, movement, depth, and dierences in brightness. Other axons constitute the
parvocellular (small cell) pathway, which carries information on color and ne detail. Some visual information
projects directly back into the brain, while other information crosses to the opposite side of the brain. This
crossing of optical pathways produces the distinctive optic chiasma (Greek, for crossing) found at the base
of the brain and allows us to coordinate information from both eyes.
Once in the brain, visual information is processed in several places, and its routes reect the complexity
and importance of visual information to humans and other animals.
18.4.5 Section Summary
Vision is the only photo responsive sense.
Visible light travels in waves and is a very small slice of the
electromagnetic radiation spectrum. Light waves dier based on their frequency (wavelength = hue) and
amplitude (intensity = brightness).
In the vertebrate retina, there are two types of light receptors (photoreceptors): cones and rods. Cones,
which are the source of color vision, exist in three formsL, M, and Sand they are dierentially sensitive
to dierent wavelengths.
Cones are located in the retina, along with the dim-light, achromatic receptors
(rods). Cones are found in the fovea, the central region of the retina, whereas rods are found everywhere
else throughout the retina.
Visual signals travel from the eye over the axons of retinal ganglion cells, which make up the optic nerves.
Ganglion cells come in several versions.
Some ganglion cell axons carry information on form, movement,
depth, and brightness, while other axons carry information on color and ne detail.

IMMUNE SYSTEM
Mammalian immune systems evolved for protection from
such pathogens; they are composed of an extremely diverse array of specialized cells and soluble molecules
that coordinate a rapid and exible defense system capable of providing protection from a majority of these
disease agents.
Components of the immune system constantly search the body for signs of pathogens. When pathogens
are found, immune factors are mobilized to the site of an infection. The immune factors identify the nature
of the pathogen, strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat it eciently, and then halt the
immune response after the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage. The immune system
can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more ecient response upon re-exposure.
This memory can last several decades.
Features of the immune system, such as pathogen identication,
specic response, amplication, retreat, and remembrance are essential for survival against pathogens. The
immune response can be classied as either innate or active. The innate immune response is always present
and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing on specic ones. Conversely, the adaptive
immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specic defenses.
19.2 Innate Immunity2
The human immune system is a complex, multilayered system for defending against external and internal
threats to the integrity of the body.
The system can be divided into two types of defense systems: the
innate immune system, which is nonspecic toward a particular kind of pathogen, and the adaptive immune
Innate immunity is not caused by an infection or vaccination
and depends initially on physical and chemical barriers that work on all pathogens, sometimes called the
rst line of defense. The second line of defense of the innate system includes chemical signals that produce
inammation and fever responses as well as mobilizing protective cells and other chemical defenses.
The
adaptive immune system mounts a highly specic response to substances and organisms that do not belong
in the body. The adaptive system takes longer to respond and has a memory system that allows it to respond
with greater intensity should the body reencounter a pathogen even years later.
which is made up of physical barriers and internal defenses, responds to all pathogens.
immune system is highly specic.
The adaptive
19.2.1 External and Chemical Barriers
The body has signicant physical barriers to potential pathogens.
The skin contains the protein keratin,
which resists physical entry into cells. Other body surfaces, particularly those associated with body openings,
are protected by the mucous membranes. The sticky mucus provides a physical trap for pathogens, preventing
their movement deeper into the body. The openings of the body, such as the nose and ears, are protected
by hairs that catch pathogens, and the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract have cilia that
constantly move pathogens trapped in the mucus coat up to the mouth.
The skin and mucous membranes also create a chemical environment that is hostile to many microorganisms. The surface of the skin is acidic, which prevents bacterial growth. Saliva, mucus, and the tears of the
eye contain an enzyme that breaks down bacterial cell walls. The stomach secretions create a highly acidic
environment, which kills many pathogens entering the digestive system.
Finally, the surface of the body and the lower digestive system have a community of microorganisms
such as bacteria, archaea, and fungi that coexist without harming the body. There is evidence that these
organisms are highly benecial to their host, combating disease-causing organisms and outcompeting them
for nutritional resources provided by the host body. Despite these defenses, pathogens may enter the body
through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting on mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome
the protections of mucus or cilia.
19.2.2 Internal Defenses
When pathogens enter the body, the innate immune system responds with a variety of internal defenses.
These include the inammatory response, phagocytosis, natural killer cells, and the complement system.
A white blood
cell is larger than a red blood cell, is nucleated, and is typically able to move using amoeboid locomotion.
White blood cells in the blood and lymph recognize pathogens as foreign to the body.
Because they can move on their own, white blood cells can leave the blood to go to infected tissues. For

and pathogens. Mast cells are produced in the same way as white blood cells, but unlike circulating

white blood cells, mast cells take up residence in connective tissues and especially mucosal tissues. They
are responsible for releasing chemicals in response to physical injury. They also play a role in the allergic
response, which will be discussed later in the chapter.
When a pathogen is recognized as foreign, chemicals called cytokines are released.
A
cytokine is a
chemical messenger that regulates cell dierentiation (form and function), proliferation (production), and
gene expression to produce a variety of immune responses.
Approximately 40 types of cytokines exist in
humans. In addition to being released from white blood cells after pathogen recognition, cytokines are also
released by the infected cells and bind to nearby uninfected cells, inducing those cells to release cytokines.
This positive feedback loop results in a burst of cytokine production.
One class of early-acting cytokines is the interferons, which are released by infected cells as a warning to
nearby uninfected cells. An
interferon is a small protein that signals a viral infection to other cells. The
interferons stimulate uninfected cells to produce compounds that interfere with viral replication. Interferons
also activate macrophages and other cells.
19.2.2.1 The Inammatory Response and Phagocytosis
The rst cytokines to be produced encourage
inammation, a localized redness, swelling, heat, and pain.
Inammation is a response to physical trauma, such as a cut or a blow, chemical irritation, and infection by
pathogens (viruses, bacteria, or fungi). The chemical signals that trigger an inammatory response enter the
extracellular uid and cause capillaries to dilate (expand) and capillary walls to become more permeable,
or leaky. The serum and other compounds leaking from capillaries cause swelling of the area, which in turn
causes pain. Various kinds of white blood cells are attracted to the area of inammation. The types of white
blood cells that arrive at an inamed site depend on the nature of the injury or infecting pathogen. For

following a cut in the skin.
Cytokines also send feedback to cells of the nervous system to bring about the overall symptoms of feeling
sick, which include lethargy, muscle pain, and nausea. Cytokines also increase the core body temperature,
causing a fever. The elevated temperatures of a fever inhibit the growth of pathogens and speed up cellular
repair processes. For these reasons, suppression of fevers should be limited to those that are dangerously
high.

19.2.2.2 Natural Killer Cells
A
associated with the adaptive immune response, but infected cells are identied and destroyed by natural killer
cells, the only lymphocytes of the innate immune system. A
natural killer (NK) cell is a lymphocyte that
can kill cells infected with viruses (or cancerous cells). NK cells identify intracellular infections, especially
from viruses, by the altered expression of
major histocompatibility class (MHC) I molecules on the
surface of infected cells. MHC class I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells that provide
a sample of the cell's internal environment at any given time. Unhealthy cells, whether infected or cancerous,
display an altered MHC class I complement on their cell surfaces.
Russell)
After the NK cell detects an infected or tumor cell, it induces programmed cell death, or apoptosis.
Phagocytic cells then come along and digest the cell debris left behind. NK cells are constantly patrolling the
body and are an eective mechanism for controlling potential infections and preventing cancer progression.

IMMUNE SYSTEM
white blood cells, such as monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils.
19.2.2.3 Complement
An array of approximately 20 types of proteins, called a
complement system, is also activated by infection
or the activity of the cells of the adaptive immune system and functions to destroy extracellular pathogens.
Liver cells and macrophages synthesize inactive forms of complement proteins continuously; these proteins
are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms.
The complement system is so named because it is complementary to the innate and adaptive immune system.
Complement proteins bind to the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens
that are already tagged by the adaptive immune system. This tagging involves the attachment of specic
proteins called antibodies (discussed in detail later) to the pathogen.
When they attach, the antibodies
change shape providing a binding site for one of the complement proteins. After the rst few complement
proteins bind, a cascade of binding in a specic sequence of proteins follows in which the pathogen rapidly
becomes coated in complement proteins.
Complement proteins perform several functions, one of which is to serve as a marker to indicate the
presence of a pathogen to phagocytic cells and enhance engulfment.
Certain complement proteins can
combine to open pores in microbial cell membranes and cause lysis of the cells.
19.2.3 Section Summary
The innate immune system consists rst of physical and chemical barriers to infection including the skin and
mucous membranes and their secretions, ciliated surfaces, and body hairs. The second line of defense is an
internal defense system designed to counter pathogenic threats that bypass the physical and chemical barriers
of the body. Using a combination of cellular and molecular responses, the innate immune system identies
the nature of a pathogen and responds with inammation, phagocytosis, cytokine release, destruction by
NK cells, or the complement system.
19.3 Adaptive Immunity4
The adaptive, or acquired, immune response takes days or even weeks to become establishedmuch longer

system is activated when the innate immune response is insucient to control an infection. In fact, without
information from the innate immune system, the adaptive response could not be mobilized. There are two
cell-mediated immune response, which is controlled by activated T
cells, and the humoral or antibody- immune response, which is controlled by activated B cells and
types of adaptive responses: the
antibodies. Activated T and B cells whose surface binding sites are specic to the molecules on the pathogen
greatly increase in numbers and attack the invading pathogen. Their attack can kill pathogens directly or
they can secrete antibodies that enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens and disrupt the infection. Adaptive
immunity also involves a memory to give the host long-term protection from reinfection with the same type
of pathogen; on reexposure, this host memory will facilitate a rapid and powerful response.
CHAPTER 19.
IMMUNE SYSTEM
19.3.1 B and T Cells
Lymphocytes, which are white blood cells, are formed with other blood cells in the red bone marrow found
in many at bones, such as the shoulder or pelvic bones.
The two types of lymphocytes of the adaptive
cell depends on where in the body it matures. The B cells remain in the bone marrow to mature (hence the
name B for bone marrow), while T cells migrate to the thymus, where they mature (hence the name T
for thymus).
Maturation of a B or T cell involves becoming immunocompetent, meaning that it can recognize, by
binding, a specic molecule or antigen (discussed below). During the maturation process, B and T cells that
bind too strongly to the body's own cells are eliminated in order to minimize an immune response against the
body's own tissues. Those cells that react weakly to the body's own cells, but have highly specic receptors
on their cell surfaces that allow them to recognize a foreign molecule, or antigen, remain. This process occurs
during fetal development and continues throughout life. The specicity of this receptor is determined by the
genetics of the individual and is present before a foreign molecule is introduced to the body or encountered.
Thus, it is genetics and not experience that initially provides a vast array of cells, each capable of binding
to a dierent specic foreign molecule. Once they are immunocompetent, the T and B cells will migrate to
the spleen and lymph nodes where they will remain until they are called on during an infection. B cells are
involved in the humoral immune response, which targets pathogens loose in blood and lymph, and T cells
are involved in the cell-mediated immune response, which targets infected cells.
This scanning electron micrograph shows a T lymphocyte. T and B cells are indistin-
guishable by light microscopy but can be dierentiated experimentally by probing their surface receptors.
19.3.2 Humoral (or Antibody)-Mediated Immune Response
As mentioned, an antigen is a molecule that stimulates a response in the immune system. Not every molecule
is antigenic. B cells participate in a chemical response to antigens present in the body by producing specic
antibodies that circulate throughout the body and bind with the antigen whenever it is encountered. This is
known as the humoral immune response. As discussed, during maturation of B cells, a set of highly specic
through their variable regions.
Each B cell has only one kind of antigen receptor, which makes every B cell dierent.
Once the B
cells mature in the bone marrow, they migrate to lymph nodes or other lymphatic organs. When a B cell
encounters the antigen that binds to its receptor, the antigen molecule is brought into the cell by endocytosis
and reappears on the surface of the cell bound to an
MHC class II molecule. When this process is
complete, the B cell is sensitized. In most cases, the sensitized B cell must then encounter a specic kind
of T cell, called a helper T cell, before it is activated. The helper T cell must already have been activated
through an encounter with the antigen (discussed below).
The helper T cell binds to the antigen-MHC class II complex and is induced to release cytokines that
induce the B cell to divide rapidly, which makes thousands of identical (clonal) cells via mitosis. This process
is called clonal expansion. These daughter cells become either plasma cells or memory B cells. The memory
B cells remain inactive at this point, until another later encounter with the antigen, caused by a reinfection
by the same bacteria or virus, results in them dividing into a new population of plasma cells. The plasma
cells, on the other hand, produce and secrete large quantities, up to 100 million molecules per hour, of
antibody molecules. An
antibody, also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a protein that is produced by
plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen. Antibodies are the agents of humoral immunity. Antibodies
CHAPTER 19.
IMMUNE SYSTEM
occur in the blood, in gastric and mucus secretions, and in breast milk. Antibodies in these bodily uids
can bind pathogens and mark them for destruction by phagocytes before they can infect cells.
These antibodies circulate in the blood stream and lymphatic system and bind with the antigen whenever
it is encountered. The binding can ght infection in several ways. Antibodies can bind to viruses or bacteria
and interfere with the chemical interactions required for them to infect or bind to other cells. The antibodies
may create bridges between dierent particles containing antigenic sites clumping them all together and
preventing their proper functioning. The antigen-antibody complex stimulates the complement system described previously, destroying the cell bearing the antigen. Phagocytic cells, such as those already described,
are attracted by the antigen-antibody complexes, and phagocytosis is enhanced when the complexes are
present. Finally, antibodies stimulate inammation, and their presence in mucus and on the skin prevents
pathogen attack.
Antibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them by blocking key sites on the pathogen that
neutralization can prevent pathogens from entering and infecting host cells. The neutralized antibody-coated
pathogens can then be ltered by the spleen and eliminated in urine or feces.
Antibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages or neutrophils,
in a process called opsonization. In a process called complement xation, some antibodies provide a place
for complement proteins to bind. The combination of antibodies and complement promotes rapid clearing
of pathogens.
The production of antibodies by plasma cells in response to an antigen is called
active immunity and
describes the host's active response of the immune system to an infection or to a vaccination. There is also
a
passive immune response where antibodies come from an outside source, instead of the individual's own
plasma cells, and are introduced into the host. For example, antibodies circulating in a pregnant woman's
body move across the placenta into the developing fetus.
antibodies for up to several months after birth.
The child benets from the presence of these
In addition, a passive immune response is possible by
injecting antibodies into an individual in the form of an antivenom to a snake-bite toxin or antibodies in
blood serum to help ght a hepatitis infection.
This gives immediate protection since the body does not
need the time required to mount its own response.
Antibodies may inhibit infection by (a) preventing the antigen from binding its target,
(b) tagging a pathogen for destruction by macrophages or neutrophils, or (c) activating the complement
cascade.
CHAPTER 19.
IMMUNE SYSTEM
19.3.3 Cell-Mediated Immunity
Unlike B cells, T lymphocytes are unable to recognize pathogens without assistance.
Instead, dendritic
cells and macrophages rst engulf and digest pathogens into hundreds or thousands of antigens. Then, an
antigen-presenting cell (APC) detects, engulfs, and informs the adaptive immune response about an
infection. When a pathogen is detected, these APCs will engulf and break it down through phagocytosis.
Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC, where they will serve as an indicator to
other immune cells. A
dendritic cell is an immune cell that mops up antigenic materials in its surroundings
and presents them on its surface.
Dendritic cells are located in the skin, the linings of the nose, lungs,
stomach, and intestines. These positions are ideal locations to encounter invading pathogens. Once they
are activated by pathogens and mature to become APCs they migrate to the spleen or a lymph node.
Macrophages also function as APCs.
After phagocytosis by a macrophage, the phagocytic vesicle fuses
with an intracellular lysosome. Within the resulting phagolysosome, the components are broken down into
fragments; the fragments are then loaded onto MHC class II molecules and are transported to the cell
is processed and embedded in an MHC class II molecule. The APCs express MHC class II on their surfaces,
and when combined with a foreign antigen, these complexes signal an invader.
An antigen-presenting cell (APC), such as a macrophage, engulfs a foreign antigen,
partially digests it in a lysosome, and then embeds it in an MHC class II molecule for presentation at
the cell surface. Lymphocytes of the adaptive immune response must interact with antigen-embedded
MHC class II molecules to mature into functional immune cells.
:

dritic cells act as sentinels in the body's immune system.
T cells have many functions. Some respond to APCs of the innate immune system and indirectly induce
immune responses by releasing cytokines. Others stimulate B cells to start the humoral response as described
previously. Another type of T cell detects APC signals and directly kills the infected cells, while some are
involved in suppressing inappropriate immune reactions to harmless or self  antigens.
There are two main types of T cells: helper T lymphocytes (TH ) and the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (TC ).
The TH lymphocytes function indirectly to tell other immune cells about potential pathogens.
Cytotoxic T cells (TC ) are the key component of the cell-mediated part of the adaptive immune system
and attack and destroy infected cells. TC cells are particularly important in protecting against viral infections;
this is because viruses replicate within cells where they are shielded from extracellular contact with circulating
antibodies. Once activated, the TC creates a large clone of cells with one specic set of cell-surface receptors,
as in the case with clonal expansion of activated B cells. As with B cells, the clone includes active TC cells
and inactive memory TC cells. The resulting active TC cells then identify infected host cells. Because of
the time required to generate a population of clonal T and B cells, there is a delay in the adaptive immune
response compared to the innate immune response.
TC cells attempt to identify and destroy infected cells before the pathogen can replicate and escape,
thereby halting the progression of intracellular infections. TC cells also support NK lymphocytes to destroy
early cancers. Cytokines secreted by the TH 1 response that stimulates macrophages also stimulate TC cells
and enhance their ability to identify and destroy infected cells and tumors. A summary of how the humoral

the MHCII receptor, causing it to release cytokines. Depending on the cytokines released, this activates
either the humoral or the cell-mediated immune response.
19.3.4 Immunological Memory
The adaptive immune system has a memory component that allows for a rapid and large response upon
reinvasion of the same pathogen. During the adaptive immune response to a pathogen that has not been
encountered before, known as the
primary immune response, plasma cells secreting antibodies and dier-
entiated T cells increase, then plateau over time. As B and T cells mature into eector cells, a subset of the
A
memory cell is an antigen-specic B or T lymphocyte that does not dierentiate into an eector cell
during the primary immune response, but that can immediately become an eector cell on reexposure to
the same pathogen. As the infection is cleared and pathogenic stimuli subside, the eectors are no longer
needed and they undergo apoptosis. In contrast, the memory cells persist in the circulation.
:
and presents it on MHC class II. A helper T cell recognizes the MHC class II- antigen complex and
activates the B cell. As a result, memory B cells and plasma cells are made.
If the pathogen is never encountered again during the individual's lifetime, B and T memory cells will
circulate for a few years or even several decades and will gradually die o, having never functioned as
eector cells. However, if the host is re-exposed to the same pathogen type, circulating memory cells will
immediately dierentiate into plasma cells and TC cells without input from APCs or TH cells. This is known
as the
secondary immune response. One reason why the adaptive immune response is delayed is because
it takes time for naïve B and T cells with the appropriate antigen specicities to be identied, activated,
and proliferate. On reinfection, this step is skipped, and the result is a more rapid production of immune
defenses. Memory B cells that dierentiate into plasma cells output tens to hundreds-fold greater antibody
response may stop the infection before it can even become established, and the individual may not realize
they had been exposed.
CHAPTER 19.
IMMUNE SYSTEM
In the primary response to infection, antibodies are secreted rst from plasma cells.
Upon re-exposure to the same pathogen, memory cells dierentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells
that output a greater amount of antibody for a longer period of time.
Vaccination is based on the knowledge that exposure to noninfectious antigens, derived from known
pathogens, generates a mild primary immune response. The immune response to vaccination may not be
perceived by the host as illness but still confers immune memory.
When exposed to the corresponding
pathogen to which an individual was vaccinated, the reaction is similar to a secondary exposure. Because
each reinfection generates more memory cells and increased resistance to the pathogen, some vaccine courses
involve one or more booster vaccinations to mimic repeat exposures.
19.3.5 The Lymphatic System
Lymph is the watery uid that bathes tissues and organs and contains protective white blood cells but does
not contain erythrocytes. Lymph moves about the body through the lymphatic system, which is made up
of vessels, lymph ducts, lymph glands, and organs, such as tonsils, adenoids, thymus, and spleen.
Although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation,
maturation, and intercommunication of immune factors occur at specic sites. The blood circulates immune
cells, proteins, and other factors through the body. Approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are
leukocytes, which include monocytes (the precursor of macrophages) and lymphocytes.
Most cells in the
blood are red blood cells. Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood
circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial space, by a process called extravasation (passing
through to surrounding tissue).
Recall that cells of the immune system originate from stem cells in the bone marrow. B cell maturation
occurs in the bone marrow, whereas progenitor cells migrate from the bone marrow and develop and mature
into naïve T cells in the organ called the thymus.
Lymph gathers antigens as it drains from tissues.
These antigens then are ltered through lymph nodes
before the lymph is returned to circulation. APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and
inform nearby lymphocytes about potential pathogens.

is the site where APCs that have trapped foreign particles in the blood can communicate with lymphocytes.
Antibodies are synthesized and secreted by activated plasma cells in the spleen, and the spleen lters foreign
substances and antibody-complexed pathogens from the blood. Functionally, the spleen is to the blood as
lymph nodes are to the lymph.

19.3.6 Section Summary
The adaptive immune response is a slower-acting, longer-lasting, and more specic response than the innate
response. However, the adaptive response requires information from the innate immune system to function.
APCs display antigens on MHC molecules to naïve T cells. T cells with cell-surface receptors that bind a
specic antigen will bind to that APC. In response, the T cells dierentiate and proliferate, becoming TH
cells or TC cells. TH cells stimulate B cells that have engulfed and presented pathogen-derived antigens. B
cells dierentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies, whereas TC cells destroy infected or cancerous
cells. Memory cells are produced by activated and proliferating B and T cells and persist after a primary
exposure to a pathogen. If re-exposure occurs, memory cells dierentiate into eector cells without input
from the innate immune system.
